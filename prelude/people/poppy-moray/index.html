                <h1 id="poppy-moray-sheher-hospitable-attentive-unpredictable">Poppy Moray (she/her) - Hospitable, Attentive, Unpredictable</h1>
<p>Poppy Moray is the contracted galley cook currently out of stasis — a woman of inscrutable thoughts and indeterminate age. She's short compared to the Diasporan average, barely topping five feet in height, with light pinkish skin and brown eyes. She is also bald, with no head hair or eyebrows to speak of.</p>
<p>Most of Poppy's time is spent in the canteen: making food, mixing and sharing drinks, talking to people, cleaning the place, often all four at once. Her adherence to the bland white kitchen uniform means that she remains an incognito presence in all kinds of goings-on, which she is very observant of; sometimes she seems to know people aboard the ship more intimately than they know themselves. Despite her alarming awareness, though, Poppy remains well-liked; her kindness and insistence on hospitality makes her ubiquitously known aboard the ship, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Poppy's talents for discreetly gathering information have not gone unnoticed. Although she's technically an independent contractor, Poppy has quietly become the go-to fly on the wall during stops and shore leaves to learn tidbits of recent news. She's been in meetings with the executive track during the approach to Ngoc Linh, and while her lips are sealed, rumor has it that she'll be playing a direct part in the coordination of the <em>Cetacean's</em> response efforts.</p>
<h2 id="goat">Goat</h2>
<p>Poppy also owns a live goat, which she has creatively named <strong>Goat</strong>. Goat is a genetically-engineered dairy breed and sports a coat of short light chestnut fur, large eyes, and small pokey horns; she is very cautious of strangers, but is friendly and well-trained enough otherwise to be given free reign of the canteen when Poppy is around to supervise. Goat is fed on printed feed and greens from the hydroponics bay, and she produces a hefty amount of milk that has proven a surprising boon — fresh dairy is a rare luxury in Cosmopolitan life, and it's used extensively for cooking and to produce a variety of cheeses.</p>
<p>At the moment, it is entirely unclear how Goat was smuggled aboard the ship. She is not listed on any manifests, and the <em>Cetacean</em> has no official clearance to transport livestock in the first place. But her calmness in zero-g and reputation as a mascot figure (not to mention the fresh food) mean that the executive track's members are typically united in their response to corporate queries about the goat: what goat?</p>
<h2 id="mission-2-calypsis">Mission 2: Calypsis</h2>
<p>Poppy served as the group's chief coordinator while the group investigated, uncovered, and ultimately stopped a false flag attack on Ngoc Linh. She provided advice and intel, performed cross-checks and reconnaissance from the ship, and remotely rebooted the group's mechs from a "freeze ray" attack just before their would-be kidnappers closed the distance.</p>
<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>
<p>During a headcount after Ngoc Linh's annexation, Poppy was discovered to not be present. An all-hands search of the ship yielded no results, and nor did a sweep of the vessel's camera systems; it is presumed that she was disembarked from the ship at the time of the station's translocation. All attempts to contact her have failed, and as such, Poppy is currently classified as missing. Her current status is unknown.</p>
