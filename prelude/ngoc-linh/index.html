                <h1 id="ngoc-linh-station">Ngoc Linh Station</h1>
<p>Ngoc Linh Station is the southwesternmost blink gate in inhabited space. Located beyond the Hyades cluster and on the edge of inhabited space, the gate is analogous to a rush town — perched on the perimeter of the 32 Orionis group in the <a href="../hip25205/">HIP 25205</a> system, it has maintained a state of perpetual expansion since its initial construction, having enjoyed constant growth since its founding as a jumping-off point for exploration ships and colonial ventures interested in exploiting the region.</p>
<h2 id="demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p>Ngoc Linh is a growing population center, and owing to its nature as a blink gate, the extreme majority of its some two hundred thousand residents are immigrants from all across inhabited space, or descended from immigrants; the remainder (around seven percent), colloquially known as the old guard, can trace a lineage to the station's original seed populations.</p>
<p>Like any blink gate, Ngoc Linh has a very diverse population; an unclassifiable stew of uncounted cultures, traditions, and beliefs, left on the stove to simmer and mix. Though the station is the size of a city and under the direct administration of Union, the station maintains a frontiersy feel that stubbornly persists despite its continuing growth, perhaps in part due to being surrounded by unexplored space.</p>
<p>On top of its permanent population, Ngoc Linh supports a constant influx of transient visitors — contractors, workers, representatives, passengers, researchers, travelers, tourists, officials, colonists and more — staying temporarily on the station due to work, leisure, layover, or wanderlust. Depending on current events and the time of year, this population can fluctuate wildly, ranging from several hundred to well over fifty thousand.</p>
<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>
<p>At the broad scale, blink gates aren't like other space stations; they're expected to house a significant transient population that may even make up the majority of its residents, they are subject to consistent but unpredictable growth, and they must be scalable in throughput and capacity to match galactic trends as well as the gradual buildup of space in and around the area.</p>
<p>For this reason, Ngoc Linh Station follows a modern "modularity" formula intended to ensure easy scalability into the future. The core column — a three-kilometer long reinforced tube of supports and infrastructure — fits snugly into the center of the superstructure like a crankshaft. This column serves as the core foundation of the blink gate, and was assembled on site as part of the gate's founding. Despite the size, it can only house around ten thousand people; much of the core is taken up by the fundamental guts required to operate something so advanced as a blink gate, including a series of gigantic power lines (known as the HPEC, or the High-Power Energy Conduit) running down the entirety of the core.</p>
<p>When the core was filled to capacity, expansion began, and continues to this day. The column itself (and each subsequent expansion) is fitted with attachment points, structural hookups, and support struts that can easily be used to permanently "mount" new sections of station to the core, effectively grafting on new structure without the painful process of having to retrofit or displace extant buildup. Ngoc Linh as it is now is an amalgam of these expansion modules (called "hab slabs"), each of which has been purpose-built to serve various needs; residential, industrial, commerical, the works.</p>
<p>The blink gate itself is a structure securely mounted to the far southern end of the station: a massive ring wired to the HPEC and spanning two kilometers in diameter. The station's main ports and docking clamps can also be found nearby, perpendicular to the gate and built up around the superstructure. The vast majority of Ngoc Linh's traffic passes through these ports, and so the area in and around them is densely populated with shops, corpro branch offices, regional embassies, shipyards, and a dizzying array of restaurants both from local residents as well as soulless corpro chains. This is the Concourse, spanning a thick half-kilometer ring of Ngoc Linh. Windows facing the blink gate for a view of oncoming ships are quite popular here.</p>
<p>Mixed in with the Concourse and extending farther down the station are mixed residential areas — high-density housing mixed in with public spaces, resource distribution centers, health clinics, and other amenities you might expect to find on a modern Metropolitan city. Outside of the Concourse, most of the station's permanent population lives in this area, which is still busy but much less well-trafficked. Further still, a narrow band of industry and processing facilities is built up just before the final third of the station, serving as the demarcating line between the station's true residential zones and the darkness of its guts.</p>
<p>Roughly the last third of the station leading up to the north end is dominated largely by mission-critical infrastructural projects and public works. It is from this section of the station that its Dyson web sprouts; a bouquet of tremendous high-efficiency solar panels extending hundred of meters into vacuum like the tentacles of a jellyfish and taking up almost as much surface area as the rest of the station combined. It is from this web that Ngoc Linh draws all of its energy, and an army of engineers is required to maintain it.</p>
<p>Like the north end of Ngoc Linh, the south end also has docking areas built up along the edges, though they are typically reserved for industrial vessels, freight ships, and other craft that can be diverted from the extremely competitive docking of the Concourse.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>Ngoc Linh's governor is <a href="../../act-1/people/novelists/novel/">Novel Greenwater</a> (he/him). As a staunch partisan of the New Humanity Front, Novel's policy decisions are well-known for mirroring his ideology: a results-driven emphasis on growth, a reduction in Union control over the station, reduced official oversight, and a focus on self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>His political philosophy, colloquially known simply as "Novelism", is dominant aboard Ngoc Linh. The movement lacks a centralized message, but most approaches place an emphasis on community cohesion and preservation of individual cultural identities — ideals that often fly in the face of the cult of personality surrounding Novel himself, which casts him as a strong leader that the station needs to function.</p>
<p>The most hardline Novelists take this aspect a step further, advocating for a broad-scale increase of the governor's ability to directly affect change aboard the station with the end goal of creating the first truly independent blink gate: free to make their own choices and to decide for themselves what merits the hegemony's laws hold. Known as the indie movement, this philosophy of total independence has slowly expanded from a fringe movement to a genuine presence aboard the station in recent decades, largely thanks to an aggressive strategy shift that focuses on the prohibitions of the First Contact Accords and the negative impacts they have upon humanity, contrasting those prohibitions directly with the effects of Union oversight.</p>
<p>Novelism's contradictory beliefs are frequently highlighted by its political opponents aboard the station, who point to the governor's unhesitating willingness to wield the apparatus of the hegemony despite his ostensible philosophy of a reduction in centralized power. In particular, Novel has has proven to habitually flex the presence of Union security aboard the station in order to "bring order" to charged situations and continually advocates for their expansion, citing them as the glue of a healthy community.</p>
<p>Opposition and countercultural movements on Ngoc Linh accuse Novel of using his philosophy as a smokescreen to draw attention away from the actual decisions being made: an increase in security presence, tightening of resource distribution, a lack of community input on major construction plans and policy changes, and so on. All of these things, they argue, paint the lofty ideals of Novelism as nothing more than a front operation for a neo-anthrochauvinist philosophy of power consolidation, not power reduction. Novel himself has a notorious reputation for refusing to acknowledge the term "anthrochauvinist" at all, which only serves to make those claims more credible.</p>
<p>Despite widening cultural schisms and growing calls for change from all across the political spectrum, the governor himself enjoys wide support across Ngoc Linh. He's soft-spoken, charismatic, sheepish, and is very skilled at describing complicated things in digestible ways, all of which have made him a popular figure. All but the most vocal of his opponents are hesitant to call his actions actively malicious (at least not openly), and instead point to his contradictory policies as an indicator of inexperience, incompetence, or cowardice.</p>

<p>Following the party's revelation that Novel himself was responsible for the attacks on the train station, Novel agreed to defer his power to an emergency council comprised of members of the domestic cabinet as well as representatives chosen from the station's citizenry. Almost immediately after his public announcement of the council's formation, power fluctuations began to ripple up and down the HPEC. For the better part of half an hour, they slowly intensified before the blink gate began to spool, moving more and more quickly — far faster than it was ever built to function. A blinkspace tear formed in its center and then expanded outwards beyond its bounds, pulling in loose objects and unsecured ships as it tore free of the gate's frame and decimated it in the process.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath, a Legion-aligned invasion force headed by the UNS-CV <em>Rio Paraná</em> emerged from the gate and began surrounding the station. Backed by hundreds of corrupted chassis and ships, station security was helpless to effectively fight back against the threat as it took control of the station's maneuvering thrusters and slowly pushed the entire city into the blinkspace tear, causing it to disappear from the system without a trace. The tear then closed behind it, leaving a small collection of corrupted fighters that immediately and permanently shut down.</p>
<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>
<p>Ngoc Linh is currently under the occupation and control of Legion forces, falling within the Purview of Harrison Armory under the authority of Legion Gian Point I. Stationside security forces have been relieved of their posts, and replaced by regular patrols of infested frames and subalterns acting to some unknown orders to keep the peace according to a new and Byzantine set of laws and regulations. Those Deimosans that didn't fall under Legion's sway outright during the translocation have slowly begun disappearing, and have gone to ground or hidden themselves away to avoid what is suspected to be a campaign of kidnappings.</p>
<p>However, for a mercy, life otherwise continues largely as it used to. Repairs continue to the extensive structural damage caused during the station's sudden transit through the blink, and Legion appears content to entrust day-to-day operations to the emergency council, although it isn't clear how much power they even hold anymore.</p>
