# Brilliant Sparks (she/her) - Relaxed, Blithe, Aware

Brilliant Sparks (a shortened version of a much longer name that she isn't inclined to share) is ostensibly the *Cetacean's* chief engineer. Carrying proportions roughly close to the Diasporan average, she's very young for her role — only twenty-nine subjective years — with pasty pinkish skin, back-length reddish hair she tends to keep in a ponytail, dark green eyes, and splotches on her face. She can typically be found in her high-visibility jumpsuit, typically with a hard hat or welding helmet and always with a signature set of light blue goggles.

Theoretically, a chief engineer's responsibilities include overseeing the rest of the maintenance track and divvying out responsibilities accordingly. In practice, she has instead established a routine of locking open her office door every morning and then filling the role of a regular engineer throughout the day, occasionally serving as a liaison between tracks or distributing information from on high but typically preferring the approach of letting her subordinates decide upon their own tasks.

Brilliant is a social butterfly and spends a great deal of time with friends, of which she endeavors to have many; her small downtime schedule is often packed, but she seems to find a way to make room for anybody who feels like a talk. She is easygoing, sympathetic, eschews decorum, and has a habit of saying the quiet part out loud and embarrassing people in the process.

It goes without saying that Brilliant's personality and methods are not popular with Access Corridor, and the more corpro-minded within the executive track consistently issue reprimands whenever they get the chance; Brilliant has technically been on a probationary period for nearly two-thirds of her time on the *Cetacean.* Her uncanny acumen for the aging ship's guts, however, makes her extremely hard to replace (she has on multiple occasions detected hardware malfunctions simply from hearing imperceptible odd noises in the background) and her friendship with Quay means that it's unlikely the captain will sign off on a sacking anytime soon.

## Mission 1: In Situ

During the *Cetacean's* arrival on Ngoc Linh, Sparks provided the team with a code-spike to enter the station through remote override of a landing pad's control systems to force it to lower into the hangar. She also served as the chief coordinator, providing updates and checking in regularly to exchange information.

## Current Status

Sparks remains aboard the *Cetacean* and continues to work closely with Quay. She bumps into the team often at shared meetings and planning sessions, although she hasn't served an active role in assisting them directly since their arrival at Ngoc Linh.
