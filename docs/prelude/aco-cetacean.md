# ACO *Cetacean*

The *Cetacean* is a long-haul fuel tanker owned and operated by [Access Corridor](access-corridor.md). It's an IPS-N model, constructed to extract, refine, store, and transport liquid fuel across the vastness of Diasporan space.

As far as construction goes, the *Cetacean* is an older ship, built in 4912u; not so old to be considered antiquated, but old enough that its model is no longer in active production, and instead remains on long-term support. After its decommissioning by IPS-N in 4967u following half a century of service, Access Corridor bought the ship, retrofitted it, and integrated into their burgeoning fleet as their new flagship. Now that Access Corridor has been acquired by IPS-N directly and the corpro's new star player (the *Empyrean*) is four times as large, the *Cetacean* has returned to its roots: performing slow, ponderous routes on the edge of inhabited space, like it did in its childhood years. So it goes.

The *Cetacean* is old, but rugged. Although its core infrastructure has aged substantially and runs inefficiently, it has been kept in serviceable condition across its lifetime and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. Malfunctions, mechanical quirks, and unexplainable fluctuations in system efficiency are commonplace; but as its two past captains each attest, if you can adjust to the many problems it has, you'd be hard-pressed to find a ship that's more reliable and less unpredictable than the *Cetacean.* Come rain or shine, it'll get where it needs to go, no questions asked — as long as you're patient with it.

## Crew

The *Cetacean* is built to comfortably house just over a hundred full-time staff, and features barracks-style bunks for temporary contractors as well as eight dozen tightly-packed personal rooms for extended or permanent assignments. Its stasis chambers contain enough sarcophagi to accommodate the entire crew in rotation, plus some extra just in case. It's currently running at full capacity, with an even one hundred personnel across its roster.

## Specifications

As a fuel freighter, the *Cetacean's* dedicated role is acquiring, refining, storing, and transporting industrial amounts of fusion fuel. The ship is fully equipped to smoothly facilitate every part of this process, and features fuel scoops for mining gaseous hydrogen from gas giants, an expansive refinery and compressor, and several thousand cubic meters of storage space.

The industrial sections and hangar deck of the ship connect to a dedicated print shop, inside of which lies a Schedule 2 printer and a series of mulchers used for turning rock, unrefined ore, and raw material into feedstock. For smaller projects or personal use, portable printers can be found in designated stations scattered throughout the *Cetacean* and accessed freely by any members of the crew.

Owing to Access Corridor's focus on moving people as much as they move hardware, the Cetacean is equipped with a row of two dozen extended-stay passenger cabins along the starboard edge of the ship, each the size of a small hotel room. A short walk connects the cabins to the main amenities, which are also shared by the crew: a small gym, a feature-complete canteen and rec room, observation blisters at the fore and aft ends of the ship, a computer lab, and so on. Passengers are issued personal keycards for their stay, each of which grants full access to designated public areas of the ship; their movement into work areas, however, is forbidden without first receiving temporary access from a crew member.

The *Ceteacean* draws its power from a military-grade fusion reactor. It's enough to cover daily draw even while running at low speed, and its moment-to-moment production can be easily scaled up as needed to provide a hefty excess for short-term emergency hookups or periods of increased power draw. Portable generators are kept in reserve in case of an outage or malfunction, whereupon they can be wheeled out and fed from the plentiful fuel reserves that the ship carries.

Because the *Cetacean* is a long-haul freighter — one that can spend months or years in realtime without returning to port — the ship is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible. The ship houses a modest hydroponics farm as well as fully-stocked urgent care and medical treatment facilities, including surgical theatres and genemod kiosks.

Two smaller vessels are present in the *Cetacean's* hangar, used as away craft: the first is a nippy shuttle called the *Dolphin,* which is capable of atmospheric entry and carries up to a dozen human-sized passengers and two tons of cargo. The second, a ponderous transport ship called the *Walrus,* is intended for zero-g use only and can carry nearly two hundred tons of supplies or up to four industrial mechs for transport or mining purposes.

Last but not least, the *Cetacean's* systems contain full infrastructure for use by an administrative NHP, although at present the casket chamber is unoccupied and has instead been repurposed as storage.

## Defenses

The *Cetacean* isn't equipped for combat, and ideally wants to avoid it whenever possible. Owing to its size and the fact that it typically travels at nearlight, interdiction by pirates is typically a low risk, and this tactic of dissuasion is the *Cetacean's* main defense; in the event of an engagement, its first priority would be to flee. Failing that, bargaining or submitting to reasonable demands (such as partial forfeiture of cargo) would be vastly preferable to fighting.

If worst comes to worst, however, the *Cetacean* does remain an industrial ship; its hull is sloped and reinforced to deflect micrometeorites traveling at nearlight speeds can effortlessly soak up minor impacts and small weapons fire and is difficult to penetrate even with purpose-built hull busters. In a worst-case scenario, it can serve to absorb incoming shots aimed for critical parts of the ship long enough to evacuate them.

For offensive capabilities, the *Cetecean* has only a single option: multipurpose point-defense lasers mounted on gimbals across the hull. Under normal circumstances, these lasers run on an extra-low power setting, and automatically target oncoming asteroids to neutralize them before they strike the hull. They can safely be configured for sustained high power operation (for slicing apart rocks and debris), and could also theoretically be overclocked to fire in ultra-high power bursts for offensive use — although doing so would place a great deal of strain on the reactor.

If all else fails, the *Cetacean's* main drive can theoretically be forced into a nearlight bolt. Although the ship is technically built to withstand the maneuver, the drive core is usually a long-spool piece of hardware that accelerates very slowly. Pushing it so hard would undoubtedly cause potentially catastrophic damage to its systems and render it unable to function normally without days of repairs; as such, the maneuver remains an absolute last resort.

## Hierarchy

Chain of command aboard the *Cetacean* is oligarchic, with authority based on a priority system ranging from low numbers (more authority) to high numbers (less authority). This doesn't extend across ships; the captain of the *Cetacean* doesn't have any inherent authority over the crew of another ACO-affiliated ship, and vice versa.

Access Corridor employs the ship's executive track directly, and perhaps more importantly owns the ship itself as well as any resources, current and future, used to keep it operational. Although they're generally hands-off and content to let the ship run itself as long as it makes a profit, they and their representatives have full authority and jurisdiction over the ship.

As the *Cetacean* is one of Access Corridor's largest and most expensive assets, they have a strong interest in keeping it under their control. From deciding its day-to-day operations and serving as the final arbiter for disagreements or requests for advice, the corpro itself is top dog.

The crew is divided into "tracks" — Access Corridor's way of referring to the divisions within the ship's hierarchy. These include:

* The **executive track,** responsible for greasing the bureaucratic gears of the ship and ensuring that the crew has the resources they need to do their jobs. Composed of managers, accountants, and aides, they coordinate the other tracks as well as serving as the ship's liaisons with outsiders and the company itself;
* The **maintenance track** keeps the ship in working order by working on its superstructure, securing transport and cargo, managing the reactor and engines, and configuring the point-defense lasers. They're also responsible for appropriating and processing resources as needed — most notably operating the scooping and compression equipment used to collect liquid fuel. For its part, maintenance personnel typically handle important or mission-critical tasks; low-level work (like fixing broken appliances, replacing light bulbs, and so on) is typically delegated to the facilitation track.
* The **medical track** makes sure that the *Cetacean's* crew is healthy enough (physically and mentally) to earn their pay without being mauled by vent crabs. They fill prescriptions, perform first aid, conduct surgical operations, and provide counseling services to the rest of the crew. Third-party contractors aboard the ship also advertise and maintain the ship's genemod kiosks, which Access Corridor receives a handsome dividend to keep around.
* Finally, the **facilitation track** manages the least glamorous and most necessary work aboard the ship: meal prep, cleaning, hauling, plumbing, freight, and low-level maintenance like restocking vending machines and providing room service for passengers. Their work isn't exciting, but it's generally understood to be critical; nobody wants to live on a dark and grimy brick of metal in space, and good facilitation workers tend to commandeer a degree of respect that their low rank in the corporate oligarchy wouldn't suggest at first glance.

### NHPs

Although the *Cetacean* doesn't currently have an administrative NHP, it does feature a casket hookup. While wired into the ship's systems, an NHP would have control over much of its software and hardware, functioning as more-or-less omnipresent assistant to the human crew.

Shipboard NHPs are bound via their shackles and company directives. Though they are members of the crew like any other, their unique capabilities and position means that they're handled differently than others aboard the vessel; they're free to make judgments and decisions as they see fit, but operate outside of the regular chain of command, answering only to the highest authority aboard the ship while holding no hard authority of their own despite serving an advisory role.

In addition to the networking capabilities afforded by their casket (which is housed in an extremely high-security area of the *Cetacean* called the Cenotaph), any subalterns or drones with the appropriate hardware can be commandeered and controlled by the NHP for better executing their work or interfacing with human crew. This includes hardware under active control by a comp/con, in which case the comp/con is programmed to automatically "hand over" the unit until the NHP cuts the link.

With the authorization of the captain, an NHP can be cycled while aboard the ship. This is a multi-step process; stable cycling requires that the casket first be isolated from the systems, after which it is placed into dormancy. Only then is the hardware fully cycled — a process that can take minutes to days depending on the model — after which it is reactivated, given some time to readjust, and "plugged back in" to the ship.

Cycling outside of scheduled timeslots is intensely forbidden by protocol, and would result in all relevant parties being placed into probation until a formal investigation determines whether or not they should be sacked for gross negligence and possibly reported to the DoJ/HR.

### Comp/Cons

Other than the shipboard NHP, the *Cetacean* also includes a plethora of subalterns and drones aboard the ship, controlled either by hardcoded subroutines or by comp/cons. Although they may have a simple facsimile personality and most are capable of recognizing and producing speech, comp/cons are not intelligent or conscious; they're simply powerful computers used to control hardware in response to provided input.

Like most ships, comp/con-enabled subalterns and drones aboard the *Cetacean* are ship property, and are programmed to follow any requests or orders given by the human crew. A strict adherence to company protocol is mandatory, although how they interpret it varies per unit depending on their specifications.
