# Unknown Woman (she/her) - ???

On several occasions, a disembodied voice or spontaneous apparation has appeared before the party directly, almost always to deliver a warning or attempt to offer advice helpful to the current situation. These appearance have been sporadic and fleeting, and only recently has a common thread emerged to tie them all together. Evidence all but certainly points to this woman being one of [Legion's](legion.md) ghosts.

In the two recorded sightings that the woman has appeared, she appears short and light-skinned, with hazel brown hair tied back in a perfect ponytail and a crisp Harrison Armory dress uniform. Her body is visually overlaid with white noise, and a crack like a damaged screen runs from her right shoulder to near her left hip, creating a jagged diagonal line across her torso.

## Mission 1: In Situ

The woman spoke over a radio line directly to the *Cetacean* during its first arrival to Ngoc Linh, where she laid out the situation aboard the station and offered her advice on how to proceed and lift the lockdown. Upon investigating her further, Ice discovered that nobody had been present within the room she was ostensibly calling from (a traffic control hub), and nor would the interference have allowed her radio signal to reach the ship from that location anyway... but they did find footprints in the dust on the floor.

## Mission 3: Chekhov's Gun

Just before the group arrived at Cypress Logistics to begin their infiltration, the woman reached out over radio again, urging the group to abandon their investigation and report back to the *Cetacean* as quickly as possible to prepare for an incoming attack. The group heeded her advice, and made it back in time to witness the *Chekhov's Gun* emerging from the station's blink gate.

## Downtime 3

The woman appeared physically for the first time just before the party commenced their second investigation into Cypress Logistics, manifesting for a split second to demand that they turn off the lights and hide. Their immediate compliance may have saved their lives â€” for they could only watch as a tendril of wax emerged without warning from the blink gate and abducted another ship in port that wasn't so lucky, dragging it into the tear before vanishing entirely.

## Mission 4b: Twice Shy

As the group prepared to replace Novel Greenwater's governorship with a temporary council of station citizens, the woman appeared for a prolonged period in the flesh aboard the *Cetacean,* causing the lights within the room to burn out or shatter. She claimed that she didn't have long, but gave a detailed warning that an imminent invasion force was approaching and urged the group to evacuate as many people as possible from the Concourse and the outer reaches of the station before abruptly disappearing once more.
