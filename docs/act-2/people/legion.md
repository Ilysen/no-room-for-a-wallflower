# Legion (???)

Legion is a hostile force that appears to be responsible for the string of disappearances from blinkspace travel and expanding omninet disruptions emanating from deep space. Whether Legion is a person, thing, organization, or ideology is unknown. Legion's true motivations are unknown, although they appear to center around the settlement of a dead world known as [Gian Point.](../gian-point.md)

Legion appears to be a part of, or consider itself to be a part of, Harrison Armory; its armed forces make extensive use of the corpro's frames, and in the times when it interacts with others in a coherent way, Legion's communications all speak from the perspective of Harrison Armory. Its communications are never direct, and instead come in the form of prepared statements given to public figures, or from what seem to be half-real "ghosts" speaking for it, but it's unclear what relation these apparations have to it, nor if they are part of the same group or simply extensions of its will.

[Metavault TONATIUH](../metavault-tonatiuh.md) appears to serve an important role for Legion, although it's unclear if this is a headquarters, base of operations, or something more enigmatic. Its power appears to be centralized there, as does the bulk of its reserve and defensive forces, which simply hover in formation around the structure when not pursuing specific goals.

## Capabilities

Legion has a corruptive influence:

* Deimosans gradually lose their sense of self and eventually appear to fall into a dissociative coma, during which time they operate following an invisible agenda.
* Electronic devices begin malfunctioning or stop working entirely, then appear to enter into its direct control. Corrupted mechs operate autonomously in the field; corrupted printers begin working to unspecified orders and doctrines, producing outdated military equipment or ammunition. In extreme cases, the physical forms of such devices begin changing at a molecular level to resemble the early ThirdComm-era Harrison Armory materiel that it uses in combat.
* Anomalous effects take place on local reality. Things appear that make no sense (such as fish in bodies of water that cannot chemically support them) or change into new forms (such as a strain of feedstock hemp whose characteristics appear to be common knowledge despite nobody having ever heard of it).

This influence seems to nearly always be telegraphed by the appearance of a kaleidoscopic, waxy filament that forms large, tangled growths. This substance has been colloquialized as "wax", and causes hallucinations and dissociative effects when touched. Its physical presence appears to be necessary for its corruptive effects to take hold, although it's entirely unclear from where it "grows", and study has been difficult due to it rapidly losing coherence when parts are severed from the whole.

### Ghosts

Legion appears to be able to, through unknown principles or means, manifest half-real "ghosts" of living people, who display a varying ability to act and think autonomously. Whether these ghosts are subordinates, extensions, superiors, constructs, or guides is unknown, and Legion's reasons for manifesting them is unknown. Whether these ghosts are real people, based on real people, or are entirely original constructions is unknown. Whether or not they are genuinely intelligent or simply display intelligence like a comp/con might is unknown.

Most ghosts appear to manifest and demanifest in one-time sporadic intervals, but two permanent ghosts are known of: Legion-Commander Edwin Lamb (who appears to be serving as a coordinator of Legion's military and demonstrates an aggressively expansionist philosophy), and a [mysterious woman](jay.md) encountered by the group on several occasions, long before Ngoc Linh's translocation to unknown territory.

## Mission 1: In Situ

Halric appears to have fallen under the sway of Legion during her routine blink-sensitive calculation work, which directly led to her corruption and, subsequently, her initiation of a lockdown over Ngoc Linh. Until she was freed and the lockdown lifted, Legion-aligned mechs manifested in the streets and corridors of the station to lay siege to its security forces, but they immediately shut down or dematerialized upon Halric being freed.

## Downtime 1

Legion's anomalous effects were likely responsible for the appearance of a sample of carpenter's hemp — a strain of feedstock hemp that observers could routinely and without fail confirm was a staple crop throughout inhabited space, but could not once cite having ever read about, seen, or even heard of. The sample was removed from the hydroponics building that it was found in and remanded to the AMU for analysis.

## Downtime 2

Shortly after food crises aboard Ngoc Linh began to become truly dire, living fish were discovered in the uninhabited oceans of HIP 25205 d. These fish appeared to manifest spontaneously and en masse at consistent intervals from unobserved locations, and functioned despite a total lack of any internal organs; their insides were entirely slabs of muscle. Legion's anomalous effects are almost certainly the cause of these fish appearing.

## Mission 3: Chekhov's Gun

Legion appeared to stage a direct attack on Ngoc Linh when the *Chekhov's Gun* emerged from its blink gate and began disgorging corrupted mechs into the Concourse. When the party boarded the ship and pushed for its reactor in an attempt to neutralize it, they received text communications from a curt, sarcastic voice that appeared to be holding a second, simultaneous conversation with someone (or something?) that had a nervous, scared demeanor. Once the team reached the reactor area and survived a subsequent redirection and ambush, the ship abruptly demateralized along with much of the marauding forces below, leaving behind wrecks and damage to the surrounding structures.

## Mission 4b: Twice Shy

Following the party's revelation that Novel himself was responsible for the attacks on the train station, Novel agreed to defer his power to an emergency council comprised of members of the domestic cabinet as well as representatives chosen from the station's citizenry. Almost immediately after his public announcement of the council's formation, power fluctuations began to ripple up and down the HPEC. For the better part of half an hour, they slowly intensified before the blink gate began to spool, moving more and more quickly — far faster than it was ever built to function. A blinkspace tear formed in its center and then expanded outwards beyond its bounds, pulling in loose objects and unsecured ships as it tore free of the gate's frame and decimated it in the process.

In the immediate aftermath, a Legion-aligned invasion force headed by the UNS-CV *Rio Paraná* emerged from the gate and began surrounding the station. Backed by hundreds of corrupted chassis and ships, station security was helpless to effectively fight back against the threat as it took control of the station's maneuvering thrusters and slowly pushed the entire city into the blinkspace tear, causing it to disappear from the system without a trace before the tear closed behind it, leaving a small collection of corrupted fighters that immediately and permanently shut down.

## Current Status

Legion forces have annexed Ngoc Linh Station and currently occupy it, exercising authority over everyone living there as well as those who live aboard the ships currently trapped in the system. It emphasizes its authority as absolute, but only rarely seems inclined to actually intervene in daily life, for better or worse; Legion seems more concerned with its authority being acknowledged than exercised.
