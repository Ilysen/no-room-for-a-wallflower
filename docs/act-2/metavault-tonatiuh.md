# Metavault TONATIUH

Growing from the shattered spine of a capital ship like a tumorous growth and extending out into deep space, metavault TONATIUH shadows [Gian Point](gian-point.md) at all hours of the day. A smooth structure composed of reflective silvery-white metal, it takes the shape of three colossal triangular prisms surrounding a hexagonal core: the unmistakable logo of Harrison Armory.

TONATIUH's exact size is difficult to determine, as it appears at the same looming size regardless of an observer's proximity to it, but the superstructure appears to be much larger than the capital ship from which it sprouts. Its surface looks completely smooth, with no apparent openings and thus no traffic in or out. Sensor scans unanimously report bizarre and nonsensical reading on every spectrum imaginable, but it appears to be the epicenter from which the Bubble has grown.

The metavault is surrounded at all times by an extensive field of defense platforms and space debris that make approaching it from any angle a nightmare. Corrupted ships and mechs crowd the metavault's surroundings â€” flitting to and from in neat, orderly rows or simply phasing in and out of existence at random.
