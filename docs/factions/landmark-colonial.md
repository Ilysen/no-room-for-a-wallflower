# Landmark Colonial

Landmark Colonial is a colonization firm and a distant subsidiary of the Smith-Shimano Corpro. The lights of [Evergreen,](../places/evergreen.md) Landmark's colonial venture on [Hercynia,](../things/hercynia.md) turned on about fifty years ago and is now enjoying its second generation of growth.

As a corpro, Landmark Colonial is considered high-risk, but is very small; you've likely never heard of them until now. It has a few colonies under its belt, and maintains a low profile with cheap buys. Evergreen is a beachhead for them — a flagship colony meant to demonstrate the company's competence at settling less-than-ideal worlds — and the colony's continued success is a priority for the corpro.
