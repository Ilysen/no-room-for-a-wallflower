# Raiders

For the past fourteen months, this band of armed combatants has been harassing [Evergreen](../places/evergreen.md) with surprise attacks and guerilla warfare: raiding outlying farmsteads for supplies, picking off militia patrols outside the walls, and targeting infrastructure projects — especially the colony's expansion. Their motus operandi remains unclear, but [Patience](../people/landmark/patience.md) believes that they're claim-jumpers; [Hercynia](../things/hercynia.md) is a world ripe for exploitation, and [Landmark Colonial's](../factions/landmark-colonial.md) investment is a high-risk project with little to no security detail other than its own citizens.

Following the capture of three of the attackers — [Psalm](../people/huc/psalm.md), [Mimi](../people/huc/mimi.md), and [Appalachia](../people/huc/appalachia.md) — subsequent interrogation has brought to light a number of unexpected facts. The raiders themselves claim to be part of a population indigenous to Hercynia and descended from the Second Committee soldiers who were left behind here, with their primary goal being to protect their homes from Union — which they claim never left, and remains dedicated to wiping them out with mechs and subalterns, just like they wiped out the [first people](../things/egregorians.md). The raiders' attacks on Evergreen are a deterrent, they claim; they believe the colony to be aligned with Union, and its expansion into the valley encoraches upon their home territory, forcing them to fight back.

The truthfulness of their statements is as of yet unclear without a way to verify their authenticity.
