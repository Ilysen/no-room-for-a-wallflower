# Raiders

For the past fourteen months, this band of armed combatants has been harassing [Evergreen](../places/evergreen.md) with surprise attacks and guerilla warfare: raiding outlying farmsteads for supplies, picking off militia patrols outside the walls, and targeting infrastructure projects — especially the colony's expansion. Their motus operandi remains unclear, but [Patience](../people/landmark/patience.md) believes that they're claim-jumpers; [Hercynia](../things/hercynia.md) is a world ripe for exploitation, and [Landmark Colonial's](../factions/landmark-colonial.md) investment is a high-risk project with little to no security detail other than its own citizens.

They appear to be at home in the jungle, implying a degree of experience with this kind of hit-and-run skirmishing. Their frames appear to be largely jury-rigged and hand-maintained, and armored with segments of some kind of hard, rigid organic material — which to some is proof that they're with the [Egregorians](../things/egregorians.md) and hellbent on wiping the colony away, and to some is simply proof that the raiders are clever enough to appropriate the exoskeletons of Hercynia's most prolific crustaceans. No living captives have been captured — thus far prohibiting any kind of attempts at information-gathering — but casualties discovered post-combat have universally been human.
