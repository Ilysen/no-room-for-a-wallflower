# Andrea Lomes (she/her) — Hidebound, Anxious, Dutiful

Andrea Lomes is Ngoc Linh's standing primary chief of security, and is ultimately responsible for stabilizing its day-to-day goings on and managing its peacekeeping forces. Despite her dimunitive frame, she towers at over seven feet tall due to a set of unguligrade prosthetic legs that terminate in large, conical wedges that slot in to resemble hooves (although these can be swapped for high-friction rubber balls or three-toed robotic feet, as the need arises). Otherwise, she has light and blotchy skin, long brown hair kept in a ponytail, and dark yellow eyes.

Lomes likes to be present for official goings-on, but doesn't speak much without a good reason. Her imposing stature and armored vest belie a frightened mind, and a person who rarely speaks out for fear of worsening the present state of affairs. She is competent at her job and is frequently seen in public doing grunt work, but nonetheless blames herself for Novel's poor responses to the ongoing crises and appears to sincerely believe that he remains the best man for the task — just that he needs better help.

Unlike Novel himself, Lomes seems to hold only passing interest in the sociopolitics of the station beyond what's required to keep things tidy. She considers herself a Novelist and has significant sway in his cabinet, but self-admittedly engages little with things beyond that. In the past this has proven viable, but with increasing dissent and worsening crises, she seems to have found herself at a crossroads where her current approach will not remain viable for much longer. As of yet, however, she has yet to make any significant changes to her methods.

## Mission 1: In Situ

Although it wasn't obvious at the time due to the interference, Lomes is the first person aboard Ngoc Linh who made contact with the *Cetacean,* where she warned them of the lockdown and urged them not to approach.

## Mission 2: Calypsis

When the group put a stop to a plot to conduct a massacre against unarmed civilians in one of Ngoc Linh's train stations, Lomes arrived shortly after the conclusion of the fighting with a security escort. After a brief standoff in which she demanded their identities, she exchanged intel with the group, and reluctantly requested that they track down the source of the signal that had been remotely operating the mechs used in the attack.

Later, once the group had cornered Irukandji and Halcyon, Lomes caught up with the group and ordered a security perimeter established around their idling mechs while she assisted in taking in the two agents. After escaping an assassination attempt, she personally escorted the group back to the *Cetacean.*

## Mission 3: Chekhov's Gun

Andrea Lomes showed a rare initiative by approaching the team off the books following the conclusion of their second downtime aboard Ngoc Linh, and frankly expressed a desire to work more closely with them to uncover who or what was responsible for the foiled attack on the train station. They accepted her help, and together they conducted a lengthy and exhausting investigation, terminating in a single vaporous lead: a small administrative outlet called Cypress Logistics. Lomes authorized the group to covertly infiltrate the corpro and uncover what evidence they could.

When the group returned early to the *Cetacean* following a tip from a familiar stranger that the station was about to come under threat, she was initially confused, but quickly shifted tactics once the *Chekhov's Gun* emerged from the station's blink gate — ordering a structural scan and constructing a plan of attack before granting the team an active role in it.

## Mission 4b: Twice Shy

Once the *Chekhov's Gun* was repelled, Lomes was briefly drawn away to assist in coordination and repairs, but returned to the group and requested that they continue their prior investigation. She was unable to assist or be present, however, until the very end: when the perpetrator of the attacks was proven to be none other than the governor himself. Despite her initial feelings of shock and horror, she was forced by necessity to numb them — first in order to decide who should lead the station in the interim, and then to coordinate emergency response and evacuations in the brief time between Legion forces emerging from the blink gate and the station itself being translocated.

## Current Status

Lomes, like the rest of the station's security, appears to have been relieved of her actual peacekeeping duties when Legion took over. When she appears at all, it's on public broadcasts, usually in order to recite statements in a quiet, scared tone of voice. Her status is otherwise unknown.
