# Cypress Logistics

Cypress Logistics is a small but wide-reaching administrative outlet with operations throughout inhabited space. Specializing in developing regions, they collect a sum in order to streamline the mountain of bureaucracy and managerial work that comes with building new stations, founding new colonies, and establishing trade agreements with burgeoning settlements — all of it focused on making sure as little paperwork headache as possible is passed down to the workers themselves, who can rest content in the knowledge that they're covered.

As a corpro, Cypress Logistics isn't widely-known, but its clients swear by their promptness, transparency, discretion, and transparency with rates. Their willingness to facilitate double-blind transactions and paperwork exchange has garnered them an occasional (and perhaps well-earned) reputation as a group that'll do anything where profit is involved, but their results are undeniable.

Since Ngoc Linh's early days, Cypress Logistics has had a significant presence in its bureaucracy, serving as a facilitator for both corporate interests and the station's public sector. Their outlet aboard the blink gate has had significant ongoing investment; the station's only going to keep growing, and so too will Cypress's profits as long as it keeps doing what it does best.

## Mission 3: Calypsis

During an investigation into a false flag attack at one of Ngoc Linh's train stations, security chief Andrea Lomes found a link between Cypress Logistics and two of the mercenaries involved in facilitating the strike. It was a vaporous lead — just an indicator that the pair's payment had been passed to them through Cypress's systems — but it was enough for her to authorize the party to conduct a covert raid on its headquarters. Before the raid could happen, however, the station's blink gate opened and disgorged the *Chekhov's Gun,* which immediately began a siege on the Concourse. The raid was called off, to be returned to later.

## Mission 4b: Twice Shy

With the *Chekhov's Gun* repelled and the immediate damage repaired, Lomes resumed the investigation into the station attack. In light of the increasing danger, the corpro was in the process of moving all of its documents and operations to a private carrier docked at the station — something that would be nearly impossible to infiltrate. The party conducted their raid on the corpro's regional headquarters while they still had time, collecting a vast array of evidence before fighting their way out against a small army of private security.

The evidence the group uncovered showed no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing, but laid out beyond a shadow of a doubt that the manna used to pay Irukandji and Halcyon had passed through their systems... and that another such payment had been made to an executive within the corpro; one who was going to be having a meeting soon. Through some surveillance work, the group eavesdropped on the meeting and found a new lead: an executive from elsewhere, speaking remotely through subaltern, who would be traveling via train soon. Through further pursuit and monitoring, they pursued their new lead to its conclusion and found the true perpetrator of the attacks: station governor Novel Greenwater.

Before any further developments, Ngoc Linh was violently translocated to its new home in the Gian Point system and annexed by Legion, putting an end to any investigations for the time being.
