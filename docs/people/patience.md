Patience is [Evergreen's](../places/evergreen.md) colonial administrator, a [Landmark](../factions/landmark-colonial.md)-developed version of the SIDEWALK-J2 NHP, full-spectrum civic administration platform common across the Diaspora. SIDEWALK-J2s are known for their reliability, predictable and customizable cycling schedule, and continuity of deveopment as they invested in their assigned civic theater, not their out-of-the-envelope thinking and actions.

The full designation of this particular instance of Patience is "Patience_Evergreen_1", though they are simply called Patience by the people of Evergreen. Patience appears as a hologram of a middle-aged, well-dressed professional, hair creeping back to balding, carrying weight in the way of an aging athlete — not unlike many of the first-generation colonists that currently occupy managerial roles in Evergreen.

Patience has a driving imperative to preserve and grow the colony. Their chief executive role will end around the third of fourth generation of colonists; by that point, Evergreen is expected to be viable and self-sufficient. Then, they will step back to an advisory role, to be replaced by an organic executive and a subordinate civilian council. In the meantime, Patience is strict in their mission: Evergreen must be defended. Evergreen must persevere.

[Edena Ji](edena-ji.md) serves as Patience's attaché and second in command.
