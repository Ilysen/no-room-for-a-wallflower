# Appalachia (she/her) â€” Subdued, Serious, Focused

Appalachia is one of the [raiders](../../factions/huc.md) that has plagued [Evergreen](../../places/evergreen.md) for the past fourteen months. She served a supportive role in [Psalm's](psalm.md) sniper team, where she helmed a Scout frame that spotted for the sniper themselves. Like her squadmates, she's currently a prisoner of war within the Governor's Farm.

Slightly tan and well-built with a round face, Appalachia bears the physique of a woman accustomed to manual work. According to the militia members assigned to watch the three prisoners, she is the only one who hasn't spoken out loud whatsoever, even when they're thought to be alone.
