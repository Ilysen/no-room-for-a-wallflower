# Appalachia (she/her) — Subdued, Serious, Focused

Appalachia is one of the [raiders](../../factions/huc.md) that has plagued [Evergreen](../../places/evergreen.md) for the past fourteen months. She served a supportive role in [Psalm's](psalm.md) sniper team, where she helmed a Scout frame that spotted for the sniper themselves. Like her squadmates, she's currently a prisoner of war within the Governor's Farm.

Slightly tan and well-built with a round face, Appalachia bears the physique of a woman accustomed to manual work. According to [Mimi](mimi.md), she has great difficulty speaking out loud following a traumatic injury while in combat; it's unclear why she's still in active service despite the harm, although her ability to keep a cool head might have something to do with it.

You know very little about who Appalachia actually is. She seems quiet and understated — like she's trying to be the focus of conversation as little as possible. The only time she's communicated directly was to request a notepad and writing implement. Mimi claims that Appalachia is a good cook, but she has politely declined any offers of utensils to work with. She looks to share a bond of some kind with Mimi, but appears to barely be a step above strangers with Psalm despite them working together in combat.
