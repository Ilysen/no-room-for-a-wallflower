# Psalm (they/them) — Brash, Passionate, Headstrong

Psalm is one of the [raiders](../../factions/huc.md) that has plagued [Evergreen](../../places/evergreen.md) for the past fourteen months. Serving as a sniper for an unknown force, Psalm personally terrorized the citizens of the colony and the outlying farmsteads with surgical strikes against militia personnel and warning shots against unarmed targets (although no civilian casualties have been registered by their weapons). They were captured following a failed ambush, and they have remained sullen and reticent to speak ever since.

They look to be in their early thirties or late twenties, with a slim and lanky build complemented by pale blond hair, blue eyes, and a slack face that rarely smiles. Their mask of impassive disregard remains up at nearly all times — but it occasionally slips to reveal a cornered, frightened interior. Psalm rarely speaks, and when they do, it's usually to make a muttered remark or demand answers to a question.
