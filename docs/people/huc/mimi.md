# Mimi (she/any) — Nervous, Extroverted, Friendly

Mimi is one of the [raiders](../../factions/huc.md) that has plagued [Evergreen](../../places/evergreen.md) for the past fourteen months. She served an augmenting role in [Psalm's](psalm.md) sniper team, piloting a Support frame before her capture and relocation to the Governor's Farm following the team's failed ambush against you.

Mimi looks very young — just over twenty years old — and barely breaches five feet tall in full combat dress. She has peach skin and frizzy ginger hair. She has been very timid and reticent to speak, but shows signs of warming up to interactions and is the most cooperative of the captives, despite the ongoing language barrier meaning that little to nothing of note has yet been learned.
