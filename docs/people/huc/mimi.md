# Mimi (she/any) — Nervous, Extroverted, Friendly

Mimi is one of the [raiders](../../factions/huc.md) that has plagued [Evergreen](../../places/evergreen.md) for the past fourteen months. She served an augmenting role in [Psalm's](psalm.md) sniper team, piloting a Support frame before her capture and relocation to the Governor's Farm following the team's failed ambush against you.

Mimi is very young — just over twenty years old — and barely breaches five feet tall in full combat dress. She has peach skin and frizzy ginger hair. While initially very timid and reticent to speak, she's slowly warmed up to interactions and quickly become the most cooperative of the captives, eagerly providing a wealth of information about herself and her squadmates:

* She claims to be from a place called Daylight, although she refuses to disclose anything of its location.
* She was raised communally instead of by a single family unit.
* She's aromantic.
* She claims to be a homebrewer.
* She gets jittery hands while nervous, which is often. She piloted a support mech so that she didn't have to aim.
* She's quite extroverted, but often has trouble explaining things.
* She has an uncanny tendency to know what people are going to say before they say it.
* She drinks a type of tea brewed from dried mushrooms with apparent mild psychedelic properties.

Although serving as an enemy combatant, Mimi seems to be very unwilling to participate in the ongoing violence, only doing so because they "can't take chances". She claims that her group's leader also wants to avoid fighting, which could create an opportunity for a ceasefire if diplomatic channels can be established — although so far Evergreen has had no luck making contact.

Mimi seems to share a bond with [Appalachia](appalachia.md), although the specifics are unclear. She claims to have tried to get Psalm to open up, but with little luck; apparently they've always been this broody, even before their capture.
