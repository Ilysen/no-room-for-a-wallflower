# Egregorians

Savage and consumptive. Unusually intelligent. Swarm-based. Ferociously territorial. Extinct.

Returning.

These are all terms used to describe what is widely understood to be Hercynia's dominant species before the arrival of the Second Committee. Whatever they really were, their impact can be seen all across the planet in the ruins of ancient hive structures (analogous to termite mounds in tunnel structure) or the rusted-out hulks of mechs and ships that Union used in their campaign of extermination.

Beyond that, the Egregorian species is largely mythologized. The species is largely understood to have been wiped out, but a growing number of [Evergreen's](../places/evergreen.md) citizens have been driven paranoid by the constant attacks and insist that the bugs have returned to take back their planet. For their part, the colony's administration believes the rumors to be hearsay from unfortunate colonists who find comfort in believing that their woes are unique, rather than the simple truth that Evergreen is situated around rich natural resources that make it a ripe target for pirate attacks.

## Biology

Any and all information pertaining to Egregorian biology is based entirely around scattered records and hearsay: subterranean survey data, a single surviving limited analysis of an Egregorian worker dated back to the late 4500s, corollary papers, and so on. No photographic or physical evidence remains of their existence beyond extant tunnel structures; as such, conventional understanding extrapolates based on what scant evidence remains.

Conventional understanding indicates that average Egregorian displayed a startling ability to manipulate crude tools and, with instruction, learn to use simple human devices. They had remarkable adaptability, but are thought to have had no higher intelligence; instead, Egregorian workers were pheromone-driven drones subservient to a hive queen, much like terrestrial eusocial insects. As a species, they are understood to have been aggressively expansion-driven; despite their herbivorous diet, Egregorians were rapid breeders, and routinely engaged in inter-hive conquests, with some corollary papers theorizing the existence of a "soldier" caste, distinct from the worker caste, with a much larger body and a demeanor even more aggressive than that of disposable workers.

## Fate

Insofar as public records indicate, Hercynia was the testing ground for the General Massive Systems's initial forays and into the design and construction of the first mechanized chassis. Egregorians lacked a prey species, and by the time of the Second Committee's arrival, the biosphere was in remission following what was effectively a planetwide infestation. Through a protacted and gruelling TBK campaign, Union eventually settled the matter for good, pushing the entire species into extinction.

## Raiders' claims

Following the capture and interrogation of several of the [raiders](../factions/huc.md) that have been plaguing Evergreen, new information has come to light on the Egregorian species.

According to the captives — who refer to the Egregorians as the "first people" — they weren't at all the mindless beasts that the Second Committee treated them as. They claim that the Egregorians were people: *a* people, a genuinely sapient species, with a culture and minds and lives that were cut short when Union drove them extinct in the TBK.

They have not yet shared any further details. The authenticity of their statements cannot be verified at this time.
