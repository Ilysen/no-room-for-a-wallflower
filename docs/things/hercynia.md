Hercynia is a terrestrial world slightly larger than Cradle, crowded with new growth after many centuries of isolation. It is a planet that has spent half a millennium recovering from a war that rendered it uninhabitable. It has a number of small moons, and is located in the fourth ring of Union space — the Atlas Line.

The known world consists of two continents separated by the wide, navigable Lagunan Strait. The continent west of the Lagunan Strait, called Solo Terra, is home to [Evergreen](../places/evergreen.md) — the only human presence on the planet.

## Climate

Hercynia has a wet, temperate climate overall with breathable air that grows thin near its dry poles. The area around Evergreen is dominated by rainforests. Winters in this region are cold, dark, and wet, with snow at elevation and — in especially frigid winters — down near to sea level. The summers are long and humid with a protracted rainy season of around 40-50 days in the pre-fall months, during which thunderstorms are common.

A fast-spinning world, Hercynia enjoys a 20-hour day and a 305-day year, with long daylight hours (16-18) in the summer and shorter days in the winter.

The rain on Hercynia is slightly acidic due to leftover atmospheric refuse from the war. Gear left outside for long periods tends to degrade faster and coverings are recommended for both buildings and people during the monsoon season.

## Flora and Fauna

Life on Hercynia is carbon-based and most of it is suitable for human consumption. The entire Hercynian biome experienced what was essentially an extinction event, and has slowly been healing ever since. Five hundred years is a long time on a human scale, but on a planetary scale it is not nearly long enough for new species to step in and fill the sudden gaps. As a world, Hercynia is eerie, quiet, and empty of large terrestrial fauna. Insects and avians abound. Cranelike birds stalk the reedy shallows of the river near Evergreen, picking at the local river life. The mornings are often filled by the sound of distant, solitary birdsong.

There are very few large animals and those that do exist are almost exclusively semi-amphibious or marine. Hercynia’s plant life is earthlike: vibrant or dark green, broad-leafed, and overgrown. The trunks and leaves of the woody plants of Hercynia are very good at wicking away moisture and tend to have a waxy sheen. During the rainy season, much of the flora expresses a thick, waxy polymer that can be scraped off and is highly flammable.

Most Hercynian animals are equipped with some sort of exoskeleton and can broadly be classified as arthropods. Aside from a large and thriving population of native insects, the planet supports a vibrant ecosystem of amphibious, marine-dwelling crustaceans, some of which grow as large as a small horse and can be used as labor animals. The largest do not venture on land, can grow up to 20 or 30 meters, and either feed on zooplankton or rely on symbiotic colonies of photokinetic bacteria.

There are a wide variety of insect feeding flying animals in Hercynia that resemble the manta rays and skates of Cradle, though few grow very large. The world also has a small and developing population of imported birds, such as cranes, storks, starlings, and pigeons. The planet is home to a large population of invasive species that humans brought to the planet as food or stowaways — mostly rodents such as rats, rabbits, or ferrets, but also a few species of bird and krait. [Landmark](../factions/landmark-colonial.md) has also imported livestock such as cattle, but populations tend to be corralled near population centers.
