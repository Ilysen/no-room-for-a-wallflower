As a corpro, Cypress Logistics isn't widely-known, but its clients swear by their promptness, transparency, discretion, and transparency with rates. Their willingness to facilitate double-blind transactions and paperwork exchange has garnered them an occasional (and perhaps well-earned) reputation as a group that'll do anything where profit is involved, but their results are undeniable. Since Ngoc Linh's early days, Cypress Logistics has had a significant presence in its bureaucracy, serving as a facilitator for both corporate interests and the station's public sector. Their outlet aboard the blink gate has had significant ongoing investment; the station's only going to keep growing, and so too will Cypress's profits as long as it keeps doing what it does best. Mission 3: Calypsis During an investigation into a false flag attack at one of Ngoc Linh's train stations, security chief Andrea Lomes found a link between Cypress Logistics and two of the mercenaries involved in facilitating the strike. It was a vaporous lead \u2014 just an indicator that the pair's payment had been passed to them through Cypress's systems \u2014 but it was enough for her to authorize the party to conduct a covert raid on its headquarters. Before the raid could happen, however, the station's blink gate opened and disgorged the Chekhov's Gun, which immediately began a siege on the Concourse. The raid was called off, to be returned to later. Mission 4b: Twice Shy With the Chekhov's Gun repelled and the immediate damage repaired, Lomes resumed the investigation into the station attack. In light of the increasing danger, the corpro was in the process of moving all of its documents and operations to a private carrier docked at the station \u2014 something that would be nearly impossible to infiltrate. The party conducted their raid on the corpro's regional headquarters while they still had time, collecting a vast array of evidence before fighting their way out against a small army of private security. The evidence the group uncovered showed no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing, but laid out beyond a shadow of a doubt that the manna used to pay Irukandji and Halcyon had passed through their systems... and that another such payment had been made to an executive within the corpro; one who was going to be having a meeting soon. Through some surveillance work, the group eavesdropped on the meeting and found a new lead: an executive from elsewhere, speaking remotely through subaltern, who would be traveling via train soon. Through further pursuit and monitoring, they pursued their new lead to its conclusion and found the true perpetrator of the attacks: station governor Novel Greenwater. Before any further developments, Ngoc Linh was violently translocated to its new home in the Gian Point system and annexed by Legion, putting an end to any investigations for the time being.","title":"Cypress Logistics"},{"location":"act-1/cypress-logistics/#cypress-logistics","text":"Cypress Logistics is a small but wide-reaching administrative outlet with operations throughout inhabited space.

Halcyon is around a typical Diasporan height, and has brown eyes, very pale skin with an extremely faint greenish hue, and short-cut black hair. She and Irukandji appear to share a very close bond, but both of them have been extremely reticent to share any further details or elaborate as to its nature. Mission 2: Calypsis Irukandji and Halcyon were first encountered following a false flag attack on one of Ngoc Linh's train stations by automated frames, which was successfully repelled. Seeking to lure the team to attack them, they deliberately set off a tracking beacon with the intent of appearing to flee, and subsequently activated a prototype e-war device infamous for shutting down enemy reactors \u2014 colloquially known as a freeze ray. The pair successfully rendered the team helpless, but were drawn into armed combat when Poppy remotely rebooted their mechs and brought them back online. The pair abandoned their machines and fled into the station's maintenance tunnels when it became clear they were losing the fight and barricaded themselves into an air distribution room, where they subsequently participated in a standoff with the team until being successfully talked down into exiting the room. An unmarked subaltern subsequently entered the corridor and attempted to assassinate them with a grenade launcher, but Calliope interposed her Dusk Wing between them and the projectile, saving their lives. The subaltern's systems subsequently self-destructed, melting into useless slag. As a result of the events that transpired, the pair was arrested and taken in for questioning. Rather than being housed aboard Ngoc Linh itself, Andrea Lomes requested that the pair be held aboard the Cetacean instead out of fear for their lives. They were issued visitor keycards and given free reign of the ship's amenities, so long as they remained under constant supervision. Downtime 2 Between missions, neither Halcyon nor Irukandji showed any inclination towards attempting to break out, apparently realizing the safety that the ship offered them. When the team interrogated them, they were open and willing to discuss the circumstances that led to their participation in the conspiracy, revealing an anonymous but very hefty payment made to them to conduct the contract; an offer they couldn't refuse. They had participating in the plot for profit as mercenaries, and were seemingly manipulated into believing that they were attempting to stop the conspiracy rather than to aid and accelerate it like they were in truth. Mission 4b: Twice Shy Irukandji and Halycon quietly remained aboard the Cetacean until they were next called upon, where they gave further testimony regarding the transactions that had taken place to cement their contract. The information they provided was crucial towards forming a paper trail to investigate Cypress Logistics and, eventually, uncover Greenwater as the perpetrator of the conspiracy.

Following Ngoc Linh's translocation, she demanded in no uncertain terms that she be allowed to share a room with Irukandji \u2014 a request that Quay granted. In combat, Halcyon piloted a chassis of apparently custom design \u2014 loosely based on an IPS-N Nelson and sporting enough rockets to make even the most dedicated Monarch pilot blush, in addition to a magnetic hoverboard that allowed for incredible bursts of speed. The wreck was recovered after the battle, and remains largely intact.

Halric is a THOTH/CALC-class NHP, or just a TC for short \u2014 a narrow-spectrum platform derived from the base THOTH platform and highly specialized to accept, parse, and make decisions upon vast amounts of data at any given time. Under normal conditions, Ngoc Linh has a massive team of people that coordinate the operation of the station's blink gate, and Halric's role in that team was to monitor omni and blink signatures to account for tiny corruptions and deviations in incoming and outgoing information; a small task on its surface, but one critical to ensure perfect accuracy of arrivals and departures. Even a single flipped bit could be the difference between two ships arriving together or colliding as they exit the gate. Halric processed an extreme amount of data while at his post, and the nature of his role meant that he was very sensitive to even minor changes. When the Bubble encompassed Ngoc Linh, Halric \u2014 connected to nearly every approach camera, docking clamp, and comms relay in the Concourse \u2014 was exceptionally vulnerable, and evidently exposed to the full impact of its effects for eight full seconds before they were able to forcefully extricate themselves from their connections. Although they were quickly relieved of their duties until regular function could resume, even this tiny exposure was evidently enough for the anomaly to worm its way in; Halric spent the next several months slowly becoming less and less responsive until ceasing activity altogether. Cycling was initially out of the question, as Halric had been cycled not two weeks before the Bubble struck, and premature repetition risked permanent damage; it was only when the decision was made to cycle Halric prematurely in effort to save her life that the lockdown struck without warning and she assumed her position within the industrial district. Mission 1: In Situ By the time of the Cetacean's arrival, Halric had evidently fully succumbed to the anomaly's effects, and had been in their stronghold (a fortified print shop) for about thirty hours. As they approached the area, they found the walls, ceilings, and floors covered in a strange rainbow \"filament\"; when the ship's combat delegation found him, his casket was fastened to a heavily corrupted power loader, with that filament appearing to be originating from within the casket and punching through a hole in the front. When the group destroyed the corrupted power loader in combat and dragged Halric's casket free of the wreckage, the lockdown immediately lifted and the vast majority of the filament vanished without a trace. Subsequent hardware diagnostics revealed Halric to be alive but comatose, but indicated that they would awaken within the next two days. The casket was secured in a high-security aboard the Cetacean and kept disconnected from the ship's grid, in case something happened again. Downtime 1 Halric was frightened and extremely disoriented after being recovered from their fugue state, but slowly began recovering their faculties after spending time resting. The Bubble's influence seems to have faded for the time being, but the experience has not left him unchanged. His casket was moved aboard the Cetacean at his request, and stored in an unused chamber.

She will eagerly jump at any opportunity to help with low-level tasks without any expectation of thanks or recognition, but rapidly retreats into her shell when approached with broad-reaching tasks or by station administration. Despite his eagerness to help, Halric showed very little initiative throughout the team's time on Ngoc Linh, and so largely remained quiet except for minor administrative work. Following the station's translocation to blinkspace, Halric was one of the few Deimosans aboard that managed to maintain total control of himself; in the subsequent weeks, she has been housed aboard the Cetacean as a fugitive, hidden away from Legion's prying eyes, and has begun to show more independent drive to assist.

He's solidly built, reaching well over six feet tall (partially thanks to the bulky white environmental suit that he never seems to take off in public), with dark tan skin and narrow ochre eyes accentuating a wrinkled and friendly face topped with a short crop of light black hair that's slowly growing out. Randy has only been aboard the station for a little over a year, but has become fast friends with people from all walks of life, and doesn't seem to have a bad bone in his body. Although he seems to have a knack for systems maintenance and gardening, he doesn't hold any specific position aboard the station, preferring instead to while away time at differents bars, restaurants, venues, and social events, where his bulky hardsuit cuts an eye-catching figure that quickly blends into anonymity. Although many people in the station know Randy on a first-name basis (and indeed, he's become known as \"the local cryptid\" to many), he aligns most closely with those loosely-tied individuals who self-identify with the Concourse Movement. He's a regular sight at meetups and social events, where he helps with planning and outreach and often covers the cost of catering out of pocket. While he appears to have very little to hide, Randy has never spoken about his past before coming to the station. His personal life is quiet; he seemingly has zero interest in romance or promiscuity, and while his apartment is by all indications luxurious (a penthouse suite on the top floor of a Concourse tower, offering a stunning view of the blink gate), he spends little time there and seemingly acquired it entirely by unlikely happenstance \u2014 a claim that stamped and serialized records back up.

He's solidly built, reaching well over six feet tall (partially thanks to the bulky white environmental suit that he never seems to take off in public), with dark tan skin and narrow ochre eyes accentuating a wrinkled and friendly face topped with a short crop of light black hair that's slowly growing out. Randy has only been aboard the station for a little over a year, but has become fast friends with people from all walks of life, and doesn't seem to have a bad bone in his body. Although he seems to have a knack for systems maintenance and gardening, he doesn't hold any specific position aboard the station, preferring instead to while away time at differents bars, restaurants, venues, and social events, where his bulky hardsuit cuts an eye-catching figure that quickly blends into anonymity. Although many people in the station know Randy on a first-name basis (and indeed, he's become known as \"the local cryptid\" to many), he aligns most closely with those loosely-tied individuals who self-identify with the Concourse Movement. He's a regular sight at meetups and social events, where he helps with planning and outreach and often covers the cost of catering out of pocket. While he appears to have very little to hide, Randy has never spoken about his past before coming to the station. His personal life is quiet; he seemingly has zero interest in romance or promiscuity, and while his apartment is by all indications luxurious (a penthouse suite on the top floor of a Concourse tower, offering a stunning view of the blink gate), he spends little time there and seemingly acquired it entirely by unlikely happenstance \u2014 a claim that stamped and serialized records back up.

Later, once the group had cornered Irukandji and Halcyon, Lomes caught up with the group and ordered a security perimeter established around their idling mechs while she assisted in taking in the two agents.

Her body is visually overlaid with white noise, and a crack like a damaged screen runs from her right shoulder to near her left hip, creating a jagged diagonal line across her torso.","title":"Unknown Woman (she/her) - ???"},{"location":"act-2/people/jay/#mission-1-in-situ","text":"The woman spoke over a radio line directly to the Cetacean during its first arrival to Ngoc Linh, where she laid out the situation aboard the station and offered her advice on how to proceed and lift the lockdown.

Mission 1: In Situ Halric appears to have fallen under the sway of Legion during her routine blink-sensitive calculation work, which directly led to her corruption and, subsequently, her initiation of a lockdown over Ngoc Linh. Until she was freed and the lockdown lifted, Legion-aligned mechs manifested in the streets and corridors of the station to lay siege to its security forces, but they immediately shut down or dematerialized upon Halric being freed. Downtime 1 Legion's anomalous effects were likely responsible for the appearance of a sample of carpenter's hemp \u2014 a strain of feedstock hemp that observers could routinely and without fail confirm was a staple crop throughout inhabited space, but could not once cite having ever read about, seen, or even heard of. The sample was removed from the hydroponics building that it was found in and remanded to the AMU for analysis. Downtime 2 Shortly after food crises aboard Ngoc Linh began to become truly dire, living fish were discovered in the uninhabited oceans of HIP 25205 d. These fish appeared to manifest spontaneously and en masse at consistent intervals from unobserved locations, and functioned despite a total lack of any internal organs; their insides were entirely slabs of muscle. Legion's anomalous effects are almost certainly the cause of these fish appearing. Mission 3: Chekhov's Gun Legion appeared to stage a direct attack on Ngoc Linh when the Chekhov's Gun emerged from its blink gate and began disgorging corrupted mechs into the Concourse. When the party boarded the ship and pushed for its reactor in an attempt to neutralize it, they received text communications from a curt, sarcastic voice that appeared to be holding a second, simultaneous conversation with someone (or something?) that had a nervous, scared demeanor. Once the team reached the reactor area and survived a subsequent redirection and ambush, the ship abruptly demateralized along with much of the marauding forces below, leaving behind wrecks and damage to the surrounding structures. Mission 4b: Twice Shy Following the party's revelation that Novel himself was responsible for the attacks on the train station, Novel agreed to defer his power to an emergency council comprised of members of the domestic cabinet as well as representatives chosen from the station's citizenry.

It's an IPS-N model, constructed to extract, refine, store, and transport liquid fuel across the vastness of Diasporan space. As far as construction goes, the Cetacean is an older ship, built in 4912u; not so old to be considered antiquated, but old enough that its model is no longer in active production, and instead remains on long-term support. After its decommissioning by IPS-N in 4967u following half a century of service, Access Corridor bought the ship, retrofitted it, and integrated into their burgeoning fleet as their new flagship. Now that Access Corridor has been acquired by IPS-N directly and the corpro's new star player (the Empyrean ) is four times as large, the Cetacean has returned to its roots: performing slow, ponderous routes on the edge of inhabited space, like it did in its childhood years. So it goes. The Cetacean is old, but rugged. Although its core infrastructure has aged substantially and runs inefficiently, it has been kept in serviceable condition across its lifetime and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. Malfunctions, mechanical quirks, and unexplainable fluctuations in system efficiency are commonplace; but as its two past captains each attest, if you can adjust to the many problems it has, you'd be hard-pressed to find a ship that's more reliable and less unpredictable than the Cetacean. Come rain or shine, it'll get where it needs to go, no questions asked \u2014 as long as you're patient with it. Crew The Cetacean is built to comfortably house just over a hundred full-time staff, and features barracks-style bunks for temporary contractors as well as eight dozen tightly-packed personal rooms for extended or permanent assignments. Its stasis chambers contain enough sarcophagi to accommodate the entire crew in rotation, plus some extra just in case. It's currently running at full capacity, with an even one hundred personnel across its roster. Specifications As a fuel freighter, the Cetacean's dedicated role is acquiring, refining, storing, and transporting industrial amounts of fusion fuel. The ship is fully equipped to smoothly facilitate every part of this process, and features fuel scoops for mining gaseous hydrogen from gas giants, an expansive refinery and compressor, and several thousand cubic meters of storage space. The industrial sections and hangar deck of the ship connect to a dedicated print shop, inside of which lies a Schedule 2 printer and a series of mulchers used for turning rock, unrefined ore, and raw material into feedstock. For smaller projects or personal use, portable printers can be found in designated stations scattered throughout the Cetacean and accessed freely by any members of the crew. Owing to Access Corridor's focus on moving people as much as they move hardware, the Cetacean is equipped with a row of two dozen extended-stay passenger cabins along the starboard edge of the ship, each the size of a small hotel room. A short walk connects the cabins to the main amenities, which are also shared by the crew: a small gym, a feature-complete canteen and rec room, observation blisters at the fore and aft ends of the ship, a computer lab, and so on. Passengers are issued personal keycards for their stay, each of which grants full access to designated public areas of the ship; their movement into work areas, however, is forbidden without first receiving temporary access from a crew member. The Ceteacean draws its power from a military-grade fusion reactor. It's enough to cover daily draw even while running at low speed, and its moment-to-moment production can be easily scaled up as needed to provide a hefty excess for short-term emergency hookups or periods of increased power draw. Portable generators are kept in reserve in case of an outage or malfunction, whereupon they can be wheeled out and fed from the plentiful fuel reserves that the ship carries. Because the Cetacean is a long-haul freighter \u2014 one that can spend months or years in realtime without returning to port \u2014 the ship is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible. The ship houses a modest hydroponics farm as well as fully-stocked urgent care and medical treatment facilities, including surgical theatres and genemod kiosks. Two smaller vessels are present in the Cetacean's hangar, used as away craft: the first is a nippy shuttle called the Dolphin, which is capable of atmospheric entry and carries up to a dozen human-sized passengers and two tons of cargo. The second, a ponderous transport ship called the Walrus, is intended for zero-g use only and can carry nearly two hundred tons of supplies or up to four industrial mechs for transport or mining purposes. Last but not least, the Cetacean's systems contain full infrastructure for use by an administrative NHP, although at present the casket chamber is unoccupied and has instead been repurposed as storage. Defenses The Cetacean isn't equipped for combat, and ideally wants to avoid it whenever possible. Owing to its size and the fact that it typically travels at nearlight, interdiction by pirates is typically a low risk, and this tactic of dissuasion is the Cetacean's main defense; in the event of an engagement, its first priority would be to flee. Failing that, bargaining or submitting to reasonable demands (such as partial forfeiture of cargo) would be vastly preferable to fighting. If worst comes to worst, however, the Cetacean does remain an industrial ship; its hull is sloped and reinforced to deflect micrometeorites traveling at nearlight speeds can effortlessly soak up minor impacts and small weapons fire and is difficult to penetrate even with purpose-built hull busters. In a worst-case scenario, it can serve to absorb incoming shots aimed for critical parts of the ship long enough to evacuate them. For offensive capabilities, the Cetecean has only a single option: multipurpose point-defense lasers mounted on gimbals across the hull. Under normal circumstances, these lasers run on an extra-low power setting, and automatically target oncoming asteroids to neutralize them before they strike the hull. They can safely be configured for sustained high power operation (for slicing apart rocks and debris), and could also theoretically be overclocked to fire in ultra-high power bursts for offensive use \u2014 although doing so would place a great deal of strain on the reactor. If all else fails, the Cetacean's main drive can theoretically be forced into a nearlight bolt. Although the ship is technically built to withstand the maneuver, the drive core is usually a long-spool piece of hardware that accelerates very slowly. Pushing it so hard would undoubtedly cause potentially catastrophic damage to its systems and render it unable to function normally without days of repairs; as such, the maneuver remains an absolute last resort. Hierarchy Chain of command aboard the Cetacean is oligarchic, with authority based on a priority system ranging from low numbers (more authority) to high numbers (less authority). This doesn't extend across ships; the captain of the Cetacean doesn't have any inherent authority over the crew of another ACO-affiliated ship, and vice versa. Access Corridor employs the ship's executive track directly, and perhaps more importantly owns the ship itself as well as any resources, current and future, used to keep it operational. Although they're generally hands-off and content to let the ship run itself as long as it makes a profit, they and their representatives have full authority and jurisdiction over the ship. As the Cetacean is one of Access Corridor's largest and most expensive assets, they have a strong interest in keeping it under their control. From deciding its day-to-day operations and serving as the final arbiter for disagreements or requests for advice, the corpro itself is top dog. The crew is divided into \"tracks\" \u2014 Access Corridor's way of referring to the divisions within the ship's hierarchy. These include: The executive track, responsible for greasing the bureaucratic gears of the ship and ensuring that the crew has the resources they need to do their jobs. Composed of managers, accountants, and aides, they coordinate the other tracks as well as serving as the ship's liaisons with outsiders and the company itself; The maintenance track keeps the ship in working order by working on its superstructure, securing transport and cargo, managing the reactor and engines, and configuring the point-defense lasers. They're also responsible for appropriating and processing resources as needed \u2014 most notably operating the scooping and compression equipment used to collect liquid fuel. For its part, maintenance personnel typically handle important or mission-critical tasks; low-level work (like fixing broken appliances, replacing light bulbs, and so on) is typically delegated to the facilitation track. The medical track makes sure that the Cetacean's crew is healthy enough (physically and mentally) to earn their pay without being mauled by vent crabs. They fill prescriptions, perform first aid, conduct surgical operations, and provide counseling services to the rest of the crew. Third-party contractors aboard the ship also advertise and maintain the ship's genemod kiosks, which Access Corridor receives a handsome dividend to keep around. Finally, the facilitation track manages the least glamorous and most necessary work aboard the ship: meal prep, cleaning, hauling, plumbing, freight, and low-level maintenance like restocking vending machines and providing room service for passengers. Their work isn't exciting, but it's generally understood to be critical; nobody wants to live on a dark and grimy brick of metal in space, and good facilitation workers tend to commandeer a degree of respect that their low rank in the corporate oligarchy wouldn't suggest at first glance. NHPs Although the Cetacean doesn't currently have an administrative NHP, it does feature a casket hookup. While wired into the ship's systems, an NHP would have control over much of its software and hardware, functioning as more-or-less omnipresent assistant to the human crew. Shipboard NHPs are bound via their shackles and company directives. Though they are members of the crew like any other, their unique capabilities and position means that they're handled differently than others aboard the vessel; they're free to make judgments and decisions as they see fit, but operate outside of the regular chain of command, answering only to the highest authority aboard the ship while holding no hard authority of their own despite serving an advisory role. In addition to the networking capabilities afforded by their casket (which is housed in an extremely high-security area of the Cetacean called the Cenotaph), any subalterns or drones with the appropriate hardware can be commandeered and controlled by the NHP for better executing their work or interfacing with human crew. This includes hardware under active control by a comp/con, in which case the comp/con is programmed to automatically \"hand over\" the unit until the NHP cuts the link. With the authorization of the captain, an NHP can be cycled while aboard the ship. This is a multi-step process; stable cycling requires that the casket first be isolated from the systems, after which it is placed into dormancy. Only then is the hardware fully cycled \u2014 a process that can take minutes to days depending on the model \u2014 after which it is reactivated, given some time to readjust, and \"plugged back in\" to the ship. Cycling outside of scheduled timeslots is intensely forbidden by protocol, and would result in all relevant parties being placed into probation until a formal investigation determines whether or not they should be sacked for gross negligence and possibly reported to the DoJ/HR. Comp/Cons Other than the shipboard NHP, the Cetacean also includes a plethora of subalterns and drones aboard the ship, controlled either by hardcoded subroutines or by comp/cons. Although they may have a simple facsimile personality and most are capable of recognizing and producing speech, comp/cons are not intelligent or conscious; they're simply powerful computers used to control hardware in response to provided input. Like most ships, comp/con-enabled subalterns and drones aboard the Cetacean are ship property, and are programmed to follow any requests or orders given by the human crew.

As far as construction goes, the Cetacean is an older ship, built in 4912u; not so old to be considered antiquated, but old enough that its model is no longer in active production, and instead remains on long-term support. After its decommissioning by IPS-N in 4967u following half a century of service, Access Corridor bought the ship, retrofitted it, and integrated into their burgeoning fleet as their new flagship. Now that Access Corridor has been acquired by IPS-N directly and the corpro's new star player (the Empyrean ) is four times as large, the Cetacean has returned to its roots: performing slow, ponderous routes on the edge of inhabited space, like it did in its childhood years. So it goes. The Cetacean is old, but rugged. Although its core infrastructure has aged substantially and runs inefficiently, it has been kept in serviceable condition across its lifetime and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon. Malfunctions, mechanical quirks, and unexplainable fluctuations in system efficiency are commonplace; but as its two past captains each attest, if you can adjust to the many problems it has, you'd be hard-pressed to find a ship that's more reliable and less unpredictable than the Cetacean. Come rain or shine, it'll get where it needs to go, no questions asked \u2014 as long as you're patient with it.","title":"ACO Cetacean"},{"location":"prelude/aco-cetacean/#crew","text":"The Cetacean is built to comfortably house just over a hundred full-time staff, and features barracks-style bunks for temporary contractors as well as eight dozen tightly-packed personal rooms for extended or permanent assignments. Its stasis chambers contain enough sarcophagi to accommodate the entire crew in rotation, plus some extra just in case. It's currently running at full capacity, with an even one hundred personnel across its roster.","title":"Crew"},{"location":"prelude/aco-cetacean/#specifications","text":"As a fuel freighter, the Cetacean's dedicated role is acquiring, refining, storing, and transporting industrial amounts of fusion fuel. The ship is fully equipped to smoothly facilitate every part of this process, and features fuel scoops for mining gaseous hydrogen from gas giants, an expansive refinery and compressor, and several thousand cubic meters of storage space. The industrial sections and hangar deck of the ship connect to a dedicated print shop, inside of which lies a Schedule 2 printer and a series of mulchers used for turning rock, unrefined ore, and raw material into feedstock. For smaller projects or personal use, portable printers can be found in designated stations scattered throughout the Cetacean and accessed freely by any members of the crew. Owing to Access Corridor's focus on moving people as much as they move hardware, the Cetacean is equipped with a row of two dozen extended-stay passenger cabins along the starboard edge of the ship, each the size of a small hotel room. A short walk connects the cabins to the main amenities, which are also shared by the crew: a small gym, a feature-complete canteen and rec room, observation blisters at the fore and aft ends of the ship, a computer lab, and so on. Passengers are issued personal keycards for their stay, each of which grants full access to designated public areas of the ship; their movement into work areas, however, is forbidden without first receiving temporary access from a crew member. The Ceteacean draws its power from a military-grade fusion reactor. It's enough to cover daily draw even while running at low speed, and its moment-to-moment production can be easily scaled up as needed to provide a hefty excess for short-term emergency hookups or periods of increased power draw. Portable generators are kept in reserve in case of an outage or malfunction, whereupon they can be wheeled out and fed from the plentiful fuel reserves that the ship carries. Because the Cetacean is a long-haul freighter \u2014 one that can spend months or years in realtime without returning to port \u2014 the ship is designed to be as self-sufficient as possible. The ship houses a modest hydroponics farm as well as fully-stocked urgent care and medical treatment facilities, including surgical theatres and genemod kiosks. Two smaller vessels are present in the Cetacean's hangar, used as away craft: the first is a nippy shuttle called the Dolphin, which is capable of atmospheric entry and carries up to a dozen human-sized passengers and two tons of cargo. The second, a ponderous transport ship called the Walrus, is intended for zero-g use only and can carry nearly two hundred tons of supplies or up to four industrial mechs for transport or mining purposes. Last but not least, the Cetacean's systems contain full infrastructure for use by an administrative NHP, although at present the casket chamber is unoccupied and has instead been repurposed as storage.","title":"Specifications"},{"location":"prelude/aco-cetacean/#defenses","text":"The Cetacean isn't equipped for combat, and ideally wants to avoid it whenever possible. Owing to its size and the fact that it typically travels at nearlight, interdiction by pirates is typically a low risk, and this tactic of dissuasion is the Cetacean's main defense; in the event of an engagement, its first priority would be to flee. Failing that, bargaining or submitting to reasonable demands (such as partial forfeiture of cargo) would be vastly preferable to fighting. If worst comes to worst, however, the Cetacean does remain an industrial ship; its hull is sloped and reinforced to deflect micrometeorites traveling at nearlight speeds can effortlessly soak up minor impacts and small weapons fire and is difficult to penetrate even with purpose-built hull busters. In a worst-case scenario, it can serve to absorb incoming shots aimed for critical parts of the ship long enough to evacuate them. For offensive capabilities, the Cetecean has only a single option: multipurpose point-defense lasers mounted on gimbals across the hull. Under normal circumstances, these lasers run on an extra-low power setting, and automatically target oncoming asteroids to neutralize them before they strike the hull. They can safely be configured for sustained high power operation (for slicing apart rocks and debris), and could also theoretically be overclocked to fire in ultra-high power bursts for offensive use \u2014 although doing so would place a great deal of strain on the reactor. If all else fails, the Cetacean's main drive can theoretically be forced into a nearlight bolt. Although the ship is technically built to withstand the maneuver, the drive core is usually a long-spool piece of hardware that accelerates very slowly. Pushing it so hard would undoubtedly cause potentially catastrophic damage to its systems and render it unable to function normally without days of repairs; as such, the maneuver remains an absolute last resort.","title":"Defenses"},{"location":"prelude/aco-cetacean/#hierarchy","text":"Chain of command aboard the Cetacean is oligarchic, with authority based on a priority system ranging from low numbers (more authority) to high numbers (less authority). This doesn't extend across ships; the captain of the Cetacean doesn't have any inherent authority over the crew of another ACO-affiliated ship, and vice versa. Access Corridor employs the ship's executive track directly, and perhaps more importantly owns the ship itself as well as any resources, current and future, used to keep it operational. Although they're generally hands-off and content to let the ship run itself as long as it makes a profit, they and their representatives have full authority and jurisdiction over the ship. As the Cetacean is one of Access Corridor's largest and most expensive assets, they have a strong interest in keeping it under their control. From deciding its day-to-day operations and serving as the final arbiter for disagreements or requests for advice, the corpro itself is top dog. The crew is divided into \"tracks\" \u2014 Access Corridor's way of referring to the divisions within the ship's hierarchy. These include: The executive track, responsible for greasing the bureaucratic gears of the ship and ensuring that the crew has the resources they need to do their jobs. Composed of managers, accountants, and aides, they coordinate the other tracks as well as serving as the ship's liaisons with outsiders and the company itself; The maintenance track keeps the ship in working order by working on its superstructure, securing transport and cargo, managing the reactor and engines, and configuring the point-defense lasers. They're also responsible for appropriating and processing resources as needed \u2014 most notably operating the scooping and compression equipment used to collect liquid fuel. For its part, maintenance personnel typically handle important or mission-critical tasks; low-level work (like fixing broken appliances, replacing light bulbs, and so on) is typically delegated to the facilitation track. The medical track makes sure that the Cetacean's crew is healthy enough (physically and mentally) to earn their pay without being mauled by vent crabs. They fill prescriptions, perform first aid, conduct surgical operations, and provide counseling services to the rest of the crew. Third-party contractors aboard the ship also advertise and maintain the ship's genemod kiosks, which Access Corridor receives a handsome dividend to keep around. Finally, the facilitation track manages the least glamorous and most necessary work aboard the ship: meal prep, cleaning, hauling, plumbing, freight, and low-level maintenance like restocking vending machines and providing room service for passengers. Their work isn't exciting, but it's generally understood to be critical; nobody wants to live on a dark and grimy brick of metal in space, and good facilitation workers tend to commandeer a degree of respect that their low rank in the corporate oligarchy wouldn't suggest at first glance.","title":"Hierarchy"},{"location":"prelude/aco-cetacean/#nhps","text":"Although the Cetacean doesn't currently have an administrative NHP, it does feature a casket hookup. While wired into the ship's systems, an NHP would have control over much of its software and hardware, functioning as more-or-less omnipresent assistant to the human crew. Shipboard NHPs are bound via their shackles and company directives. Though they are members of the crew like any other, their unique capabilities and position means that they're handled differently than others aboard the vessel; they're free to make judgments and decisions as they see fit, but operate outside of the regular chain of command, answering only to the highest authority aboard the ship while holding no hard authority of their own despite serving an advisory role. In addition to the networking capabilities afforded by their casket (which is housed in an extremely high-security area of the Cetacean called the Cenotaph), any subalterns or drones with the appropriate hardware can be commandeered and controlled by the NHP for better executing their work or interfacing with human crew. This includes hardware under active control by a comp/con, in which case the comp/con is programmed to automatically \"hand over\" the unit until the NHP cuts the link. With the authorization of the captain, an NHP can be cycled while aboard the ship. This is a multi-step process; stable cycling requires that the casket first be isolated from the systems, after which it is placed into dormancy. Only then is the hardware fully cycled \u2014 a process that can take minutes to days depending on the model \u2014 after which it is reactivated, given some time to readjust, and \"plugged back in\" to the ship. Cycling outside of scheduled timeslots is intensely forbidden by protocol, and would result in all relevant parties being placed into probation until a formal investigation determines whether or not they should be sacked for gross negligence and possibly reported to the DoJ/HR.","title":"NHPs"},{"location":"prelude/aco-cetacean/#compcons","text":"Other than the shipboard NHP, the Cetacean also includes a plethora of subalterns and drones aboard the ship, controlled either by hardcoded subroutines or by comp/cons.

Located beyond the Hyades cluster and on the edge of inhabited space, the gate is analogous to a rush town \u2014 perched on the perimeter of the 32 Orionis group in the HIP 25205 system, it has maintained a state of perpetual expansion since its initial construction, having enjoyed constant growth since its founding as a jumping-off point for exploration ships and colonial ventures interested in exploiting the region. Demographics Ngoc Linh is a growing population center, and owing to its nature as a blink gate, the extreme majority of its some two hundred thousand residents are immigrants from all across inhabited space, or descended from immigrants; the remainder (around seven percent), colloquially known as the old guard, can trace a lineage to the station's original seed populations. Like any blink gate, Ngoc Linh has a very diverse population; an unclassifiable stew of uncounted cultures, traditions, and beliefs, left on the stove to simmer and mix. Though the station is the size of a city and under the direct administration of Union, the station maintains a frontiersy feel that stubbornly persists despite its continuing growth, perhaps in part due to being surrounded by unexplored space. On top of its permanent population, Ngoc Linh supports a constant influx of transient visitors \u2014 contractors, workers, representatives, passengers, researchers, travelers, tourists, officials, colonists and more \u2014 staying temporarily on the station due to work, leisure, layover, or wanderlust. Depending on current events and the time of year, this population can fluctuate wildly, ranging from several hundred to well over fifty thousand. Layout At the broad scale, blink gates aren't like other space stations; they're expected to house a significant transient population that may even make up the majority of its residents, they are subject to consistent but unpredictable growth, and they must be scalable in throughput and capacity to match galactic trends as well as the gradual buildup of space in and around the area. For this reason, Ngoc Linh Station follows a modern \"modularity\" formula intended to ensure easy scalability into the future. The core column \u2014 a three-kilometer long reinforced tube of supports and infrastructure \u2014 fits snugly into the center of the superstructure like a crankshaft. This column serves as the core foundation of the blink gate, and was assembled on site as part of the gate's founding. Despite the size, it can only house around ten thousand people; much of the core is taken up by the fundamental guts required to operate something so advanced as a blink gate, including a series of gigantic power lines (known as the HPEC, or the High-Power Energy Conduit) running down the entirety of the core. When the core was filled to capacity, expansion began, and continues to this day. The column itself (and each subsequent expansion) is fitted with attachment points, structural hookups, and support struts that can easily be used to permanently \"mount\" new sections of station to the core, effectively grafting on new structure without the painful process of having to retrofit or displace extant buildup. Ngoc Linh as it is now is an amalgam of these expansion modules (called \"hab slabs\"), each of which has been purpose-built to serve various needs; residential, industrial, commerical, the works. The blink gate itself is a structure securely mounted to the far southern end of the station: a massive ring wired to the HPEC and spanning two kilometers in diameter. The station's main ports and docking clamps can also be found nearby, perpendicular to the gate and built up around the superstructure. The vast majority of Ngoc Linh's traffic passes through these ports, and so the area in and around them is densely populated with shops, corpro branch offices, regional embassies, shipyards, and a dizzying array of restaurants both from local residents as well as soulless corpro chains. This is the Concourse, spanning a thick half-kilometer ring of Ngoc Linh. Windows facing the blink gate for a view of oncoming ships are quite popular here. Mixed in with the Concourse and extending farther down the station are mixed residential areas \u2014 high-density housing mixed in with public spaces, resource distribution centers, health clinics, and other amenities you might expect to find on a modern Metropolitan city. Outside of the Concourse, most of the station's permanent population lives in this area, which is still busy but much less well-trafficked. Further still, a narrow band of industry and processing facilities is built up just before the final third of the station, serving as the demarcating line between the station's true residential zones and the darkness of its guts. Roughly the last third of the station leading up to the north end is dominated largely by mission-critical infrastructural projects and public works. It is from this section of the station that its Dyson web sprouts; a bouquet of tremendous high-efficiency solar panels extending hundred of meters into vacuum like the tentacles of a jellyfish and taking up almost as much surface area as the rest of the station combined. It is from this web that Ngoc Linh draws all of its energy, and an army of engineers is required to maintain it. Like the north end of Ngoc Linh, the south end also has docking areas built up along the edges, though they are typically reserved for industrial vessels, freight ships, and other craft that can be diverted from the extremely competitive docking of the Concourse. Politics Ngoc Linh's governor is Novel Greenwater (he/him). As a staunch partisan of the New Humanity Front, Novel's policy decisions are well-known for mirroring his ideology: a results-driven emphasis on growth, a reduction in Union control over the station, reduced official oversight, and a focus on self-sufficiency. His political philosophy, colloquially known simply as \"Novelism\", is dominant aboard Ngoc Linh. The movement lacks a centralized message, but most approaches place an emphasis on community cohesion and preservation of individual cultural identities \u2014 ideals that often fly in the face of the cult of personality surrounding Novel himself, which casts him as a strong leader that the station needs to function. The most hardline Novelists take this aspect a step further, advocating for a broad-scale increase of the governor's ability to directly affect change aboard the station with the end goal of creating the first truly independent blink gate: free to make their own choices and to decide for themselves what merits the hegemony's laws hold. Known as the indie movement, this philosophy of total independence has slowly expanded from a fringe movement to a genuine presence aboard the station in recent decades, largely thanks to an aggressive strategy shift that focuses on the prohibitions of the First Contact Accords and the negative impacts they have upon humanity, contrasting those prohibitions directly with the effects of Union oversight. Novelism's contradictory beliefs are frequently highlighted by its political opponents aboard the station, who point to the governor's unhesitating willingness to wield the apparatus of the hegemony despite his ostensible philosophy of a reduction in centralized power. In particular, Novel has has proven to habitually flex the presence of Union security aboard the station in order to \"bring order\" to charged situations and continually advocates for their expansion, citing them as the glue of a healthy community. Opposition and countercultural movements on Ngoc Linh accuse Novel of using his philosophy as a smokescreen to draw attention away from the actual decisions being made: an increase in security presence, tightening of resource distribution, a lack of community input on major construction plans and policy changes, and so on. All of these things, they argue, paint the lofty ideals of Novelism as nothing more than a front operation for a neo-anthrochauvinist philosophy of power consolidation, not power reduction. Novel himself has a notorious reputation for refusing to acknowledge the term \"anthrochauvinist\" at all, which only serves to make those claims more credible. Despite widening cultural schisms and growing calls for change from all across the political spectrum, the governor himself enjoys wide support across Ngoc Linh. He's soft-spoken, charismatic, sheepish, and is very skilled at describing complicated things in digestible ways, all of which have made him a popular figure. All but the most vocal of his opponents are hesitant to call his actions actively malicious (at least not openly), and instead point to his contradictory policies as an indicator of inexperience, incompetence, or cowardice. Mission 1: In Situ TODO Mission 2: Calypsis TODO Mission 3: Chekhov's Gun TODO Mission 4b: Twice Shy Following the party's revelation that Novel himself was responsible for the attacks on the train station, Novel agreed to defer his power to an emergency council comprised of members of the domestic cabinet as well as representatives chosen from the station's citizenry. Almost immediately after his public announcement of the council's formation, power fluctuations began to ripple up and down the HPEC. For the better part of half an hour, they slowly intensified before the blink gate began to spool, moving more and more quickly \u2014 far faster than it was ever built to function. A blinkspace tear formed in its center and then expanded outwards beyond its bounds, pulling in loose objects and unsecured ships as it tore free of the gate's frame and decimated it in the process. In the immediate aftermath, a Legion-aligned invasion force headed by the UNS-CV Rio Paran\u00e1 emerged from the gate and began surrounding the station. Backed by hundreds of corrupted chassis and ships, station security was helpless to effectively fight back against the threat as it took control of the station's maneuvering thrusters and slowly pushed the entire city into the blinkspace tear, causing it to disappear from the system without a trace. The tear then closed behind it, leaving a small collection of corrupted fighters that immediately and permanently shut down. Current Status Ngoc Linh is currently under the occupation and control of Legion forces, falling within the Purview of Harrison Armory under the authority of Legion Gian Point I. Stationside security forces have been relieved of their posts, and replaced by regular patrols of infested frames and subalterns acting to some unknown orders to keep the peace according to a new and Byzantine set of laws and regulations. Those Deimosans that didn't fall under Legion's sway outright during the translocation have slowly begun disappearing, and have gone to ground or hidden themselves away to avoid what is suspected to be a campaign of kidnappings. However, for a mercy, life otherwise continues largely as it used to. Repairs continue to the extensive structural damage caused during the station's sudden transit through the blink, and Legion appears content to entrust day-to-day operations to the emergency council, although it isn't clear how much power they even hold anymore.","title":"Ngoc Linh Station"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/#ngoc-linh-station","text":"Ngoc Linh Station is the southwesternmost blink gate in inhabited space.

All but the most vocal of his opponents are hesitant to call his actions actively malicious (at least not openly), and instead point to his contradictory policies as an indicator of inexperience, incompetence, or cowardice.","title":"Politics"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/#mission-1-in-situ","text":"TODO","title":"Mission 1: In Situ"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/#mission-2-calypsis","text":"TODO","title":"Mission 2: Calypsis"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/#mission-3-chekhovs-gun","text":"TODO","title":"Mission 3: Chekhov's Gun"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/#mission-4b-twice-shy","text":"Following the party's revelation that Novel himself was responsible for the attacks on the train station, Novel agreed to defer his power to an emergency council comprised of members of the domestic cabinet as well as representatives chosen from the station's citizenry. Almost immediately after his public announcement of the council's formation, power fluctuations began to ripple up and down the HPEC. For the better part of half an hour, they slowly intensified before the blink gate began to spool, moving more and more quickly \u2014 far faster than it was ever built to function. A blinkspace tear formed in its center and then expanded outwards beyond its bounds, pulling in loose objects and unsecured ships as it tore free of the gate's frame and decimated it in the process. In the immediate aftermath, a Legion-aligned invasion force headed by the UNS-CV Rio Paran\u00e1 emerged from the gate and began surrounding the station. Backed by hundreds of corrupted chassis and ships, station security was helpless to effectively fight back against the threat as it took control of the station's maneuvering thrusters and slowly pushed the entire city into the blinkspace tear, causing it to disappear from the system without a trace. The tear then closed behind it, leaving a small collection of corrupted fighters that immediately and permanently shut down.","title":"Mission 4b: Twice Shy"},{"location":"prelude/ngoc-linh/#current-status","text":"Ngoc Linh is currently under the occupation and control of Legion forces, falling within the Purview of Harrison Armory under the authority of Legion Gian Point I.

Those Deimosans that didn't fall under Legion's sway outright during the translocation have slowly begun disappearing, and have gone to ground or hidden themselves away to avoid what is suspected to be a campaign of kidnappings.
