Tall apartment buildings stand a dozen stories high, grime-streaked white monoliths wrapped in cling-tight plastic, looming above the low mixed-material buildings at their feet. The colony is bordered by a low wall, with construction pushing right up against the barrier. Smoke drifts up from the dense settlement and blends with low rain clouds. This is Evergreen, a colony in its second generation and home about eleven thousand citizens. The only permanent settlement on Hercynia, it's managed by a corpro by the name of Landmark Colonial and has enjoyed fifty years of smooth sailing up until the recent attacks that began just over a year ago. Layout and Surroundings Click to open Evergreen\u2019s western edge is bordered by a wide, slow-moving river. Across the water is a broad expanse of semi-developed farmland that stretches for kilometers before petering out into thick, temperate rainforest. The colony\u2019s initial urban growth boundary was defined by [Patience,](../people/patience.md) the colony\u2019s administrative NHP, and staked out by planners and construction workers. Tall, vacant apartment blocks stand close to the river \u2013 ten-plus stories of habitats built, sealed, and awaiting their tenants \u2014 and loom over the comparatively small, populated inland districts, which are composed of smaller apartment blocks, two to three stories tall. This eastern side of Evergreen looks out towards the strait. A squat prefab wall rings the current boundaries of the city; beyond is a muddy clear-cut, expanding every day as massive drone cutters and their handlers chew into the old growth east of the city center. The colony\u2019s landing bowl \u2014 where ships land and depart \u2013 rests a few kilometers southeast of the settlement as well. Until the summer, it is flooded, the pad at the bottom in need of repair. Daily Life Click to open For the last 50 years, life in Evergreen has been fairly mundane. Patience determines the roles of individual colonists based on a combination of their SSC-calculated \u201cgenetic predispositions\u201d, agglomerated aptitude tests, and personal preferences, then assigns daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly tasks designed to guide their development and career goals. For most colonists, this means one of three things: they produce, engineer, or facilitate. The production track includes farming, crafting, resource extraction, harvesting, manufacturing, fabrication, and other responsibilities with a focus on physical good production and maintenance. These colonists tend to be the ones growing, harvesting, and preparing foodstuffs, biofuel, raw materials, consumable goods, and so on. Farmers, brewers, clothiers, carpenters, loggers, miners, ranchers, and general workers are all counted in this category. This is the track for all-rounders and skilled general laborers, meant to ensure that the colony has a wide base of talent and human resources from which it can draw. Engineer-track colonists adopt industrial and scientific roles and others that require deeper or more specialized training. An engineer-track colonist might be an electrical or mechanical engineer, a subaltern technician, a printmaster, a meteorologist, an omninet specialist, a nuclear engineer, a drone pilot, a doctor, or a medical technician. These people are specialists, meant to ensure the colony\u2019s systems are as efficient and reliable as possible. The facilitator track, last of all, is a fluid category with a focus on interpersonal aptitude. The colonists assigned to these roles are teachers, foremen, operations managers, city planners, coders, bureaucrats, assistants, and therapists \u2014 people who work to ensure the smooth functioning of the colony and the health of its people, now and into the future. The militia is made up of a third of each of these tracks, augmented by subaltern units. Locations Click to open Residential Districts The city\u2019s residential districts are generally composed of mixed high-density apartments, transit corridors, and short, walkable blocks. The western quadrants are the most built up, and the least occupied \u2013 they were built for future generations to move in and occupy. The streets in those areas are largely vacant. The eastern side, meanwhile, is lower built and less dense \u2013 though not significantly so \u2013 and is home to the bulk of Evergreen\u2019s population. Founders Bridge A bridge in the process of being built across Evergreen\u2019s river, the Founders Bridge connects the agricultural western bank to the built-up eastern bank. The concrete bridge is halfway complete. A wooden bridge spans the rest of the distance, built across pylons that will later support the completed bridge. Currently, the bridge can support foot traffic, ground cars, and beasts of burden, but not mechs. Stable Reactor Plant Well downriver, on the east side of the river, sit the twin coolant towers of Evergreen\u2019s Stable Reactor Plant, Towers 1 & 2. Salvaged from the colony ship that brought the first generation of colonists to Hercynia, the stable reactors at the plant can theoretically power Evergreen for millennia. A paved road leads from the colony to the reactor, where there is also a small campus for the reactor\u2019s engineers. The day-to-day functions of the plant are largely automated, controlled by an on-site comp/con and monitored by Patience, with ultimate executive authority given over to on-site engineers. Communication Towers 1, 2, and 3 Evergreen\u2019s local omninet and subomni communications are bolstered by three communications towers set up in a triangle around the settlement. Their primary function is to increase the broadcast range of the colony\u2019s radio coverage and better direct comms lasers into and out of the valley in which the settlement lies. As a secondary function, they can provide limited-bandwidth omninet communications in the event of a node shutdown. The Bottom of the Well A popular and well-trafficked tavern, the Bottom of the Well is a hunched, three-story building with an enclosed patio area. It is set against the river with docks extending out into the shallows. The whole first floor is a bar, meeting place, and performance space. One wall opens out onto the docks and can be buttoned up in the cold. The second and third floors contain modest one-bedroom apartments. The roof offers another patio space, where laundry is often air-dried during the summer. You have comfortable, functional lodgings here. The Bottom is owned by Mir Bahadur, a first-generation Evergreen-Hercynian in his late sixties. Mir once worked for Castor Fielding as an engineer and maintains a friendly relationship with him. Governor's Farm Built in the center of the city, the Governor\u2019s Farm is a walled complex serving as the administrative heart of Evergreen. It houses not only Patience\u2019s physical architecture, but the Council Hall, the town\u2019s municipal data storage center, the militia\u2019s main armory, a cold gene storage site, the settlement\u2019s omninet tower, and its largest printer, along with a number of administrative offices and outbuildings. Gated checkpoints control ingress and egress at each cardinal direction. The central cluster of administrative buildings, including the Council Hall, is colloquially called \u201cthe Governor\u2019s Mansion\u201d. This is where Patience holds office. Depot District Located in the northeast quadrant of Evergreen, the depot district is a busy industrial area where stored and harvested goods are housed before use. Native materials \u2014 stone, lumber, and so on \u2014 are brought in through a number of checkpoints and gates along the eastern growth boundary and housed in the district\u2019s many warehouses. Much of the district is full of prepackaged, premade materials, offloaded from the colony ship upon arrival. These resources are kept under lock and key. A host of drone swarms patrol the depot district, with hive nexuses located atop each warehouse, while the colony\u2019s large industrial drones park in orderly ranks on broad pads of concrete. Beyond the Walls Click to open Evergreen is nestled on the floor of a wide valley bordered by tall, snow-capped mountains. Its climate is most like that of a temperate rainforest, with summer storms that bring floods and, rarely, snow that reaches the valley floor in the winter. In the lands around Evergreen, some colonists have made their homes on lonely tracts of cultivated farmland. The soil is rich enough now to produce sturdy crops. Native trees butt up against waving regiments of tall corns, their stalks supported by legume vines and modest gourds. Rice paddies march along the river upstream from Evergreen, siphoning the cool water out from the wide current. It is rare, but not unheard of, for colonists ranging out in any direction to encounter the rusted, decaying remains of old Union ships or mechs, forgotten after the resolution of the whatever long-forgotten war happened here. The citizens of Evergreen have been told to flag the wreckage and avoid the area, as there might be old munitions lingering in the ruins. Further out lie areas of dense growth, as yet unexplored by the colonists. Bands of the planet\u2019s surface have been imaged by passing ships, but these are standard-definition still images, poor in data beyond what is offered by the visual spectrum and shallow radar; they are scans of opportunity, at best. A distant mountain range marks the northern horizon \u2014 no more than a low bruise across the horizon. Clouds spill down from the valley\u2019s western slopes, soaking the deep woods in steady, warm rain. Further still, the land stretches for thousands and thousands of kilometers, forest eventually giving way to a frost tundra beyond a series of massive mountain ranges and broad plains. Partly a product of the natural rain shadow and partly the result of an initial glassing campaign by Union, the tundra becomes increasingly dry and cold the closer one gets to the pole. To the colony\u2019s east and west, the valley walls rise up to alpine heights from deep woods. To the east, Solo Terra is wooded and ripples with mountains. This landscape eventually gives way to a coastline that dissolves into a gray and turbulent strait, dividing the landmass from its eastern cousin \u2013 a largely unexplored and undocumented land. The west mirrors the east, with forests that run for thousands of kilometers until ocean, split only by riverlands and plains. The west is dotted with the scattered wrecks of ships that crash-landed on Hercynia, the remains of aboveground Egregorian tower-hives, and desolation scars where nothing grows. South of Evergreen, the valley floor is broken by sudden buttes \u2014 evidence of the planet\u2019s ancient glacial past \u2014 and is divided by a wide, slow river that winds south through shimmering grasslands. To the south, the forest eventually runs out into plains. Further still, the continent shatters into an ocean marked by thousands of islands that become more and more tropical the closer you get to the equator. No other continent stands between these archipelagos and the southern pole. Miscellena Click to open Everyday life in Evergreen is goal-driven and worked in AM and PM shifts. Most production and construction occurs during the earlier shifts, while maintenance and the quieter production and construction jobs are undertaken during the PM shifts. Patience is, essentially, omnipresent. Colonists\u2019 homes (the ones on the grid, at least) are all patched into Patience via their resident comp/con units, personal assistants that keep their calendars and schedules, reminders, contacts, and so on. Most colonists have also fabricated slates. Patience listens, collects, and collates all data in their central storage unit below the Governor\u2019s Farm. The relationship is one-way: while the comp/cons can feed information back to Patience, colonists typically can\u2019t access high-level data from the NHP without clearance granted by their job portfolios. Evergreen operates on a hundred-year plan: a century after landfall, the colony will be at capacity \u2014 two hundred thousand citizens \u2014 and well on the way to a complete transition from an NHP-administered settlement to one governed by a fully organic leadership. In the meantime, Patience runs the show, with interpersonal conflicts handled by a Settler\u2019s Council of elected representatives. Requisition is the currency of Evergreen. Patience administers colonists\u2019 license data and apportions out print time. Colonists receive a guaranteed base level of requisition with the ability to earn more through training and education, completion of assigned goals, community service, celebrations of birthdays and other holidays, community service, victory in local sports leagues, artistic pursuits, and so on. When dealing with the unsanctioned homesteads of the Gray Towns, colonists barter goods and services. There is, of course, a healthy unsanctioned market in Evergreen that runs in parallel to the official economy. Evergreen has five festivals: Settlement Day (a celebration of the colony\u2019s foundation), New Year\u2019s Day, Heart of Winter (a festive dinner at the heart of winter), Summer\u2019s Dawn (usually a field day at the beginning of summer), and Landmark Day (a mandatory celebration of the foundation of Landmark Colonial).","title":"Evergreen"},{"location":"places/evergreen/#evergreen","text":"A burgeoning settlement brutalized by grown and nestled against the banks of a river.

Farmers, brewers, clothiers, carpenters, loggers, miners, ranchers, and general workers are all counted in this category. This is the track for all-rounders and skilled general laborers, meant to ensure that the colony has a wide base of talent and human resources from which it can draw. Engineer-track colonists adopt industrial and scientific roles and others that require deeper or more specialized training. An engineer-track colonist might be an electrical or mechanical engineer, a subaltern technician, a printmaster, a meteorologist, an omninet specialist, a nuclear engineer, a drone pilot, a doctor, or a medical technician. These people are specialists, meant to ensure the colony\u2019s systems are as efficient and reliable as possible. The facilitator track, last of all, is a fluid category with a focus on interpersonal aptitude. The colonists assigned to these roles are teachers, foremen, operations managers, city planners, coders, bureaucrats, assistants, and therapists \u2014 people who work to ensure the smooth functioning of the colony and the health of its people, now and into the future. The militia is made up of a third of each of these tracks, augmented by subaltern units.","title":"Daily Life"},{"location":"places/evergreen/#locations","text":"Click to open","title":"Locations"},{"location":"places/evergreen/#beyond-the-walls","text":"Click to open Evergreen is nestled on the floor of a wide valley bordered by tall, snow-capped mountains. Its climate is most like that of a temperate rainforest, with summer storms that bring floods and, rarely, snow that reaches the valley floor in the winter. In the lands around Evergreen, some colonists have made their homes on lonely tracts of cultivated farmland. The soil is rich enough now to produce sturdy crops. Native trees butt up against waving regiments of tall corns, their stalks supported by legume vines and modest gourds. Rice paddies march along the river upstream from Evergreen, siphoning the cool water out from the wide current. It is rare, but not unheard of, for colonists ranging out in any direction to encounter the rusted, decaying remains of old Union ships or mechs, forgotten after the resolution of the whatever long-forgotten war happened here. The citizens of Evergreen have been told to flag the wreckage and avoid the area, as there might be old munitions lingering in the ruins. Further out lie areas of dense growth, as yet unexplored by the colonists. Bands of the planet\u2019s surface have been imaged by passing ships, but these are standard-definition still images, poor in data beyond what is offered by the visual spectrum and shallow radar; they are scans of opportunity, at best. A distant mountain range marks the northern horizon \u2014 no more than a low bruise across the horizon. Clouds spill down from the valley\u2019s western slopes, soaking the deep woods in steady, warm rain. Further still, the land stretches for thousands and thousands of kilometers, forest eventually giving way to a frost tundra beyond a series of massive mountain ranges and broad plains. Partly a product of the natural rain shadow and partly the result of an initial glassing campaign by Union, the tundra becomes increasingly dry and cold the closer one gets to the pole. To the colony\u2019s east and west, the valley walls rise up to alpine heights from deep woods. To the east, Solo Terra is wooded and ripples with mountains. This landscape eventually gives way to a coastline that dissolves into a gray and turbulent strait, dividing the landmass from its eastern cousin \u2013 a largely unexplored and undocumented land. The west mirrors the east, with forests that run for thousands of kilometers until ocean, split only by riverlands and plains. The west is dotted with the scattered wrecks of ships that crash-landed on Hercynia, the remains of aboveground Egregorian tower-hives, and desolation scars where nothing grows. South of Evergreen, the valley floor is broken by sudden buttes \u2014 evidence of the planet\u2019s ancient glacial past \u2014 and is divided by a wide, slow river that winds south through shimmering grasslands. To the south, the forest eventually runs out into plains. Further still, the continent shatters into an ocean marked by thousands of islands that become more and more tropical the closer you get to the equator. No other continent stands between these archipelagos and the southern pole.","title":"Beyond the Walls"},{"location":"places/evergreen/#miscellena","text":"Click to open Everyday life in Evergreen is goal-driven and worked in AM and PM shifts. Most production and construction occurs during the earlier shifts, while maintenance and the quieter production and construction jobs are undertaken during the PM shifts. Patience is, essentially, omnipresent. Colonists\u2019 homes (the ones on the grid, at least) are all patched into Patience via their resident comp/con units, personal assistants that keep their calendars and schedules, reminders, contacts, and so on. Most colonists have also fabricated slates. Patience listens, collects, and collates all data in their central storage unit below the Governor\u2019s Farm. The relationship is one-way: while the comp/cons can feed information back to Patience, colonists typically can\u2019t access high-level data from the NHP without clearance granted by their job portfolios. Evergreen operates on a hundred-year plan: a century after landfall, the colony will be at capacity \u2014 two hundred thousand citizens \u2014 and well on the way to a complete transition from an NHP-administered settlement to one governed by a fully organic leadership. In the meantime, Patience runs the show, with interpersonal conflicts handled by a Settler\u2019s Council of elected representatives. Requisition is the currency of Evergreen. Patience administers colonists\u2019 license data and apportions out print time. Colonists receive a guaranteed base level of requisition with the ability to earn more through training and education, completion of assigned goals, community service, celebrations of birthdays and other holidays, community service, victory in local sports leagues, artistic pursuits, and so on. When dealing with the unsanctioned homesteads of the Gray Towns, colonists barter goods and services. There is, of course, a healthy unsanctioned market in Evergreen that runs in parallel to the official economy. Evergreen has five festivals: Settlement Day (a celebration of the colony\u2019s foundation), New Year\u2019s Day, Heart of Winter (a festive dinner at the heart of winter), Summer\u2019s Dawn (usually a field day at the beginning of summer), and Landmark Day (a mandatory celebration of the foundation of Landmark Colonial).","title":"Miscellena"},{"location":"places/gray-towns/","text":"Gray Towns Some hundred kilometers to the east and south of Evergreen are dozens of the so-called \u201cGray Towns\u201d - the \u201cgray\u201d in the name describing their legal relationship to Landmark .

Liu Maize originated as a collective of homesteads bound together by an agreement of mutual aid and unconditional hospitality. At the time, those farms were affiliated with Evergreen, and the compact was a practical measure intended to assist in maintaining stability so far out from the burgeoning colony, which could provide little material support; over time, though, it's gradually formed into a collective of independent farms under a single name, bound together by what has evolved into a charter, legal document, and code of conduct all in one: the Compact. Layout and Surroundings Today, \"Liu Maize\" refers to both the collective itself as well as to the crossroads town that has sprung up roughly in the middle of the scattered farms, where the homesteaders gather and mingle. Evergreen's legal definition encompasses only the latter. It's largely built of prefabs acquired by the settlement from Evergreen surplus, but mixed-material buildings stand out here and there on the outskirts of wide dirt roads that make room for trucks and industrial mechs. Liu Maize's population is very diffuse. The \"town\" itself is very small; you can walk from one end to the other in less than ten minutes. The vast bulk of the collective's population is concentrated in their homesteads, scattered throughout the nutrient-rich tracts of loamy soil that dominate this part of the valley. Unlike Evergreen and Merricktown , farms in this part of Solo Terra are landlocked; their infrastructure can't rely on the large river that facilitates daily life for Hercynia's other settlers. Without running water to cool a fusion reactor, settlers rely on wind farms and lots of batteries in order to keep the lights on. The constant rain in this part of the continent means that solar power is unreliable, but it's also a boon: the municipal water supply is largely treated storm water, collected in massive barrels on the edge of the settlement and purified in a prefab treatment plant that rests at the town's heart to be distributed to whoever needs it.

Resources are managed and distributed collectively; homesteads keep each other updated on what they have and share what they need to. This has run into some friction as more and more independent settlers join the cooperative, but for the time being it's managed to work itself out.

Nearly half of the valley's comestibles flow through Liu Maize, and it's led to a thriving culinary scene.

Unusually intelligent. Swarm-based. Ferociously territorial. Extinct. Returning. These are all terms used to describe what is widely understood to be Hercynia's dominant species before the arrival of the Second Committee. Whatever they really were, their impact can be seen all across the planet in the ruins of ancient hive structures (analogous to termite mounds in tunnel structure) or the rusted-out hulks of mechs and ships that Union used in their campaign of extermination.

The species is largely understood to have been wiped out, but a growing number of Evergreen's citizens have been driven paranoid by the constant attacks and insist that the bugs have returned to take back their planet. For their part, the colony's administration believes the rumors to be hearsay from unfortunate colonists who find comfort in believing that their woes are unique, rather than the simple truth that Evergreen is situated around rich natural resources that make it a ripe target for pirate attacks. Biology Any and all information pertaining to Egregorian biology is based entirely around scattered records and hearsay: subterranean survey data, a single surviving limited analysis of an Egregorian worker dated back to the late 4500s, corollary papers, and so on. No photographic or physical evidence remains of their existence beyond extant tunnel structures; as such, conventional understanding extrapolates based on what scant evidence remains. Conventional understanding indicates that average Egregorian displayed a startling ability to manipulate crude tools and, with instruction, learn to use simple human devices. They had remarkable adaptability, but are thought to have had no higher intelligence; instead, Egregorian workers were pheromone-driven drones subservient to a hive queen, much like terrestrial eusocial insects. As a species, they are understood to have been aggressively expansion-driven; despite their herbivorous diet, Egregorians were rapid breeders, and routinely engaged in inter-hive conquests, with some corollary papers theorizing the existence of a \"soldier\" caste, distinct from the worker caste, with a much larger body and a demeanor even more aggressive than that of disposable workers. Fate Insofar as public records indicate, Hercynia was the testing ground for the General Massive Systems's initial forays and into the design and construction of the first mechanized chassis. Egregorians lacked a prey species, and by the time of the Second Committee's arrival, the biosphere was in remission following what was effectively a planetwide infestation. Through a protacted and gruelling TBK campaign, Union eventually settled the matter for good, pushing the entire species into extinction.","title":"Egregorians"},{"location":"things/egregorians/#egregorians","text":"Savage and consumptive.

For their part, the colony's administration believes the rumors to be hearsay from unfortunate colonists who find comfort in believing that their woes are unique, rather than the simple truth that Evergreen is situated around rich natural resources that make it a ripe target for pirate attacks.","title":"Egregorians"},{"location":"things/egregorians/#biology","text":"Any and all information pertaining to Egregorian biology is based entirely around scattered records and hearsay: subterranean survey data, a single surviving limited analysis of an Egregorian worker dated back to the late 4500s, corollary papers, and so on. No photographic or physical evidence remains of their existence beyond extant tunnel structures; as such, conventional understanding extrapolates based on what scant evidence remains. Conventional understanding indicates that average Egregorian displayed a startling ability to manipulate crude tools and, with instruction, learn to use simple human devices. They had remarkable adaptability, but are thought to have had no higher intelligence; instead, Egregorian workers were pheromone-driven drones subservient to a hive queen, much like terrestrial eusocial insects. As a species, they are understood to have been aggressively expansion-driven; despite their herbivorous diet, Egregorians were rapid breeders, and routinely engaged in inter-hive conquests, with some corollary papers theorizing the existence of a \"soldier\" caste, distinct from the worker caste, with a much larger body and a demeanor even more aggressive than that of disposable workers.","title":"Biology"},{"location":"things/egregorians/#fate","text":"Insofar as public records indicate, Hercynia was the testing ground for the General Massive Systems's initial forays and into the design and construction of the first mechanized chassis. Egregorians lacked a prey species, and by the time of the Second Committee's arrival, the biosphere was in remission following what was effectively a planetwide infestation. Through a protacted and gruelling TBK campaign, Union eventually settled the matter for good, pushing the entire species into extinction.","title":"Fate"},{"location":"things/hercynia/","text":"Hercynia Hercynia is a terrestrial world slightly larger than Cradle, crowded with new growth after many centuries of isolation. It is a planet that has spent half a millennium recovering from a war that rendered it uninhabitable. It has a number of small moons, and is located in the fourth ring of Union space \u2014 the Atlas Line. The known world consists of two continents separated by the wide, navigable Lagunan Strait. The continent west of the Lagunan Strait, called Solo Terra, is home to Evergreen \u2014 the only human presence on the planet. Climate Hercynia has a wet, temperate climate overall with breathable air that grows thin near its dry poles. The area around Evergreen is dominated by rainforests. Winters in this region are cold, dark, and wet, with snow at elevation and \u2014 in especially frigid winters \u2014 down near to sea level. The summers are long and humid with a protracted rainy season of around 40-50 days in the pre-fall months, during which thunderstorms are common. A fast-spinning world, Hercynia enjoys a 20-hour day and a 305-day year, with long daylight hours (16-18) in the summer and shorter days in the winter. The rain on Hercynia is slightly acidic due to leftover atmospheric refuse from the war. Gear left outside for long periods tends to degrade faster and coverings are recommended for both buildings and people during the monsoon season. Flora and Fauna Life on Hercynia is carbon-based and most of it is suitable for human consumption. The entire Hercynian biome experienced what was essentially an extinction event, and has slowly been healing ever since. Five hundred years is a long time on a human scale, but on a planetary scale it is not nearly long enough for new species to step in and fill the sudden gaps. As a world, Hercynia is eerie, quiet, and empty of large terrestrial fauna. Insects and avians abound. Cranelike birds stalk the reedy shallows of the river near Evergreen, picking at the local river life. The mornings are often filled by the sound of distant, solitary birdsong. There are very few large animals and those that do exist are almost exclusively semi-amphibious or marine. Hercynia\u2019s plant life is earthlike: vibrant or dark green, broad-leafed, and overgrown. The trunks and leaves of the woody plants of Hercynia are very good at wicking away moisture and tend to have a waxy sheen. During the rainy season, much of the flora expresses a thick, waxy polymer that can be scraped off and is highly flammable. Most Hercynian animals are equipped with some sort of exoskeleton and can broadly be classified as arthropods. Aside from a large and thriving population of native insects, the planet supports a vibrant ecosystem of amphibious, marine-dwelling crustaceans, some of which grow as large as a small horse and can be used as labor animals. The largest do not venture on land, can grow up to 20 or 30 meters, and either feed on zooplankton or rely on symbiotic colonies of photokinetic bacteria. There are a wide variety of insect feeding flying animals in Hercynia that resemble the manta rays and skates of Cradle, though few grow very large. The world also has a small and developing population of imported birds, such as cranes, storks, starlings, and pigeons. The planet is home to a large population of invasive species that humans brought to the planet as food or stowaways \u2014 mostly rodents such as rats, rabbits, or ferrets, but also a few species of bird and krait. Landmark has also imported livestock such as cattle, but populations tend to be corralled near population centers.","title":"Hercynia"},{"location":"things/hercynia/#hercynia","text":"Hercynia is a terrestrial world slightly larger than Cradle, crowded with new growth after many centuries of isolation.
