                <h1 id="randy-hehim-good-natured-easygoing-curious">Randy (he/him) - Good-Natured, Easygoing, Curious</h1>
<p>Randy is a heavyset man of murky background currently living aboard Ngoc Linh on "extended vacation". He's solidly built, reaching well over six feet tall (partially thanks to the bulky white environmental suit that he never seems to take off in public), with dark tan skin and narrow ochre eyes accentuating a wrinkled and friendly face topped with a short crop of light black hair that's slowly growing out.</p>
<p>Randy has only been aboard the station for a little over a year, but has become fast friends with people from all walks of life, and doesn't seem to have a bad bone in his body. Although he seems to have a knack for systems maintenance and gardening, he doesn't hold any specific position aboard the station, preferring instead to while away time at differents bars, restaurants, venues, and social events, where his bulky hardsuit cuts an eye-catching figure that quickly blends into anonymity.</p>
<p>Although many people in the station know Randy on a first-name basis (and indeed, he's become known as "the local cryptid" to many), he aligns most closely with those loosely-tied individuals who self-identify with the Concourse Movement. He's a regular sight at meetups and social events, where he helps with planning and outreach and often covers the cost of catering out of pocket.</p>
<p>While he appears to have very little to hide, Randy has never spoken about his past before coming to the station. His personal life is quiet; he seemingly has zero interest in romance or promiscuity, and while his apartment is by all indications luxurious (a penthouse suite on the top floor of a Concourse tower, offering a stunning view of the blink gate), he spends little time there and seemingly acquired it entirely by unlikely happenstance — a claim that stamped and serialized records back up. These facts taken together have caused an inherent suspicion within the Movement that he still occasionally falls afoul of, but that doesn't seem to upset him.</p>
<h2 id="mission-2-calypsis">Mission 2: Calypsis</h2>
<p>Randy did not make a direct appearance while the group from the <em>Cetacean</em> investigated the plot against the Concourse Movement, but was among the organizers being targeted and framed by the attack. Their handiness in stopping the attack and exposing the plot meant that the framing failed, and he remained free and safe.</p>
<h2 id="mission-4b-twice-shy">Mission 4b: Twice Shy</h2>
<p>When Novel Greenwater was discovered to be behind the attacks and sabotage aboard Ngoc Linh, Andrea Lomes and the team (with input from Quay and, ironically, from Novel himself) collectively decided to elect an interim emergency council of leaders to manage stationside affairs until the crisis was resolved. Randy was chosen as one of the members of this council, protesting vehemently at first before resignedly accepting the mantle.</p>
<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>
<p>The emergency council (including Randy) had not yet first convened before the station came under attack and was translocated. Following Legion's takeover of the governmental apparatus, the council themselves was placed beneath the direct command of Legion, and currently serves in part as a mouthpiece for its orders, although they retain a good deal of control over daily affairs.</p>
