                <h1 id="halcyon-sheher-cautious-witty-steadfast">Halcyon (she/her) - Cautious, Witty, Steadfast</h1>
<p>One of two agents captured in the aftermath of a foiled conspiracy on Ngoc Linh, with the other being <a href="../irukandji/">Irukandji</a>. Halcyon is around a typical Diasporan height, and has brown eyes, very pale skin with an extremely faint greenish hue, and short-cut black hair. She and Irukandji appear to share a very close bond, but both of them have been extremely reticent to share any further details or elaborate as to its nature.</p>
<h2 id="mission-2-calypsis">Mission 2: Calypsis</h2>
<p>Irukandji and Halcyon were first encountered following a false flag attack on one of Ngoc Linh's train stations by automated frames, which was successfully repelled. Seeking to lure the team to attack them, they deliberately set off a tracking beacon with the intent of appearing to flee, and subsequently activated a prototype e-war device infamous for shutting down enemy reactors — colloquially known as a freeze ray. The pair successfully rendered the team helpless, but were drawn into armed combat when Poppy remotely rebooted their mechs and brought them back online.</p>
<p>The pair abandoned their machines and fled into the station's maintenance tunnels when it became clear they were losing the fight and barricaded themselves into an air distribution room, where they subsequently participated in a standoff with the team until being successfully talked down into exiting the room. An unmarked subaltern subsequently entered the corridor and attempted to assassinate them with a grenade launcher, but Calliope interposed her Dusk Wing between them and the projectile, saving their lives. The subaltern's systems subsequently self-destructed, melting into useless slag.</p>
<p>As a result of the events that transpired, the pair was arrested and taken in for questioning. Rather than being housed aboard Ngoc Linh itself, Andrea Lomes requested that the pair be held aboard the <em>Cetacean</em> instead out of fear for their lives. They were issued visitor keycards and given free reign of the ship's amenities, so long as they remained under constant supervision.</p>
<h2 id="downtime-2">Downtime 2</h2>
<p>Between missions, neither Halcyon nor Irukandji showed any inclination towards attempting to break out, apparently realizing the safety that the ship offered them. When the team interrogated them, they were open and willing to discuss the circumstances that led to their participation in the conspiracy, revealing an anonymous but very hefty payment made to them to conduct the contract; an offer they couldn't refuse. They had participating in the plot for profit as mercenaries, and were seemingly manipulated into believing that they were attempting to <em>stop</em> the conspiracy rather than to aid and accelerate it like they were in truth.</p>
<h2 id="mission-4b-twice-shy">Mission 4b: Twice Shy</h2>
<p>Irukandji and Halycon quietly remained aboard the <em>Cetacean</em> until they were next called upon, where they gave further testimony regarding the transactions that had taken place to cement their contract. The information they provided was crucial towards forming a paper trail to investigate Cypress Logistics and, eventually, uncover Greenwater as the perpetrator of the conspiracy.</p>
<h2 id="current-status">Current Status</h2>
<p>Halcyon, like Irukandji, remains in captivity aboard the <em>Cetacean.</em> Despite all that's transpired, she appears to remain amenable and cooperative. Following Ngoc Linh's translocation, she demanded in no uncertain terms that she be allowed to share a room with Irukandji — a request that Quay granted.</p>
<p>In combat, Halcyon piloted a chassis of apparently custom design — loosely based on an IPS-N Nelson and sporting enough rockets to make even the most dedicated Monarch pilot blush, in addition to a magnetic hoverboard that allowed for incredible bursts of speed. The wreck was recovered after the battle, and remains largely intact. Like its pilot, the mech is currently kept under lock and key aboard the <em>Cetacean.</em></p>
